Mkoa wa zamani wa Bengal uligawanywa katika majimbo mawili mapya \"Bengal\" (iliyojumuisha Bengal Magharibi na mkoa wa Bihar na Orissa) na Bengal ya Mashariki na Assam na Dacca kama mji mkuu wa mwisho. Kuhesabu kulipandishwa kwa sababu za kiutawala: Bengal ilikuwa kijiografia kama Ufaransa na ilikuwa na idadi kubwa zaidi. Curzon alisema mkoa wa Mashariki ulipuuzwa na kutawaliwa. Kwa kugawanya mkoa, utawala ulioboreshwa unaweza kuanzishwa Mashariki, ambapo baadaye, idadi ya watu ingefaidika na shule mpya na fursa za ajira. Wahindu wa West Bengal ambao walitawala biashara ya Bengal na maisha ya vijijini walilalamika kwamba mgawanyiko huo ungewafanya wachache katika mkoa ambao ungejumuisha mkoa wa Bihar na Orissa.

Alikuwa wa kwanza kutumia jina la Milima ya Trans-Antarctic (miaka miwili baadaye, iliyoandaliwa kama Milima ya Transantarctic) kwa aina hiyo ya km 3,500. Hamilton alitambua kuwa sekta kubwa ya safu hii ilikuwa na miamba ya granitic ya kipekee kama ukanda wa Adelaide Orogenic wa Australia Kusini. Fossils zinazohusiana na umri tofauti huko Antarctica, Australia, na kusini mwa Afrika ziliunganisha zaidi mabara haya, na kuunga mkono maelezo ya wakati huo ya drift ya bara.

The triple Xs were back on the company logo and were used on almost all of Pearl's advertisements. The Xs held this significant role to the end of production at the brewery in 2001, when the brewery closed its doors and the company logo was abandoned. As production of Pearl and Pearl Light spun up at Miller's Fort Worth facility, the product logos were redesigned. The updated label does not use the triple Xs, so a significant part of company identity has been virtually eliminated from the Pearl beers. However, Pearl's Country Club malt liquor still displays the XXXs in its logo.\nMany people wonder where the Xs came from, and how were they ever used on beer. In truth, the three Xs are actually a quality rating system. The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century. As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party. The courier's job was to sample beer at inns along the way. If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn's sign or door with a single X. If the inn's beer was deemed good, the sign or door would receive two Xs. A mark on an inn of three Xs meant that the beer inside was excellent, and a must-stop for the royal court as they passed through.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Kampuni ya Pearl Brewing\nContent: Triple XS ilipitishwa na Chama cha Brewing cha San Antonio kuonyesha mambo mawili: ubora wa juu wa bia zao, na kiburi ambacho wafanyikazi waliweka katika bidhaa zao.

Mnamo miaka ya 1960, Pearl ilichukua Kampuni ya Goetz Brewing na kutengeneza pombe ya Klabu ya Malt moja ya bidhaa muhimu za Pearl. Wakati Club ya Nchi ilipokea bidhaa yake pekee ya bidhaa miaka michache baada ya ununuzi, ilipata Xs tatu katika nembo yake. XS ilikuwa katika kituo cha juu cha taji ya nembo.

There are many axioms in the production of dentures that must be understood; ignorance of one axiom can lead to failure of the denture. In the vast majority of cases, complete dentures should be comfortable soon after insertion, although almost always at least two adjustment visits are necessary to remove the cause of sore spots. One of the most critical aspects of dentures is that the impression of the denture must be perfectly made and used with perfect technique to make an accurate model of the patient's edentulous (toothless) gums. The dentist or denturist must use a process called border molding to ensure that the denture flanges are properly extended. An array of problems may occur if the final impression of the denture is not made properly. It takes considerable patience and experience for a dentist to know how to make a denture, and for this reason it may be in the patient's best interest to seek a specialist, either a prosthodontist or denturist, to make the denture. A denturist is a trained and licensed professional who sees patients in need of dentures, partials, relines or repairs. A denturist not only takes the impression, but makes the entire denture in his or her own laboratory. The denturist then schedules a date for the delivery of the finished dentures to the patient. A general dentist may do a good job making dentures, but only if he or she is meticulous and experienced. Many dentists no longer make dentures themselves. but instead take an impression of the patients' mouth and then either send the impressions to a dental laboratory, which could be anywhere in the world, or send the patient to a denturist. Once the laboratory receives dental impressions of the patient's mouth, the laboratory creates plaster molds from them. The laboratory uses the molds to create the wax rims used to register the patient's bite. These wax rims are returned to the dentist, who uses them to register the patient's bite. The dentist may assist the patient in choosing the correct size of teeth for the dentures, or simply make the selection himself. Once bite registration is completed and the teeth are selected for the dentures, the wax rim is usually returned to the dental laboratory in order to have the denture teeth set into the wax. Once the teeth are set into the wax rim, the result is a prefinished denture that looks almost like the finished product. This prefinished denture is usually returned to the dentist's office and the patient usually has a chance to approve the setup (for immediate or standard dentures) or to try the denture before it is finished. After approval by the patient, the dentist returns the pre-denture to the laboratory for final processing. The finished denture is then returned to the dentist's office for delivery to the patient.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Safi ya meno\nContent: Kisafishaji cha meno (pia huitwa Cleanser ya meno), ni safi inayotumika kusafisha meno wakati iko nje ya mdomo.

Wanaanza kuzeeka na kudhoofisha wakiwa na umri wa miaka 10 hadi 15 hivi karibuni.

Wanawake mara nyingi hutetea kwa ukali watoto wao kutoka kwa mwanaume anayechukua lakini hawafaulu sana isipokuwa kikundi cha mama watatu au wanne ndani ya vikosi vya kujiunga na vikosi dhidi ya mwanaume.

Specialty drugs are often biologics—\"drugs derived from living cells\" that are injectable or infused (although some are oral medications). They are used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, H.I.V. psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and hepatitis C. In 1990 there were 10 specialty drugs on the market, in the mid-1990s there were fewer than 30, by 2008 there were 200, and by 2015 there were 300. Drugs are often defined as specialty because their price is much higher than that of non-specialty drugs. Medicare defines any drug for which the negotiated price is $670 per month or more, as a specialty drug which is placed in a specialty tier that requires a higher patient cost sharing. Drugs are also identified as specialty when there is a special handling requirement or the drug is only available via a limited distributions network. By 2015 \"specialty medications accounted for one-third of all spending on drugs in the United States, up from 19 percent in 2004 and heading toward 50 percent in the next 10 years\", according to IMS Health, which tracks prescriptions. According to a 2010 article in Forbes, specialty drugs for rare diseases became more expensive \"than anyone imagined\" and their success came \"at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses\" was \"in decline\". In 2015 analysis by \"The Wall Street Journal\" suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Dawa maalum nchini Merika\nContent: Mnamo Septemba 27, 2007 Rais George W.

Tradition tells of their further journeyings from Hawaiki to New Zealand, and some commentators have identified this homeland as Havai'i, an island in the Society Group. Overpopulation, scarcity of food and civil war forced many of them to migrate once more, and New Zealand became their new home. Māori settled New Zealand between AD 1280–1320. They quickly learnt to hunt the numerous species of moa and seals in New Zealand and settled across the North and South islands in less than a few decades.

Kulikuwa na makazi ya Briteni kwa muda wote wa karne na mwanzoni mwa karne ijayo.

He was the second child and only son of Jonathan Swift (1640–1667) and his wife Abigail Erick (or Herrick) of Frisby on the Wreake. His father was a native of Goodrich, Herefordshire, but he accompanied his brothers to Ireland to seek their fortunes in law after their Royalist father's estate was brought to ruin during the English Civil War. His maternal grandfather, James Ericke, was the vicar of Thornton, England. In 1634 the vicar was convicted of Puritan practices.

Uchapishaji wa kazi hiyo uliambatana na Swift akijigonga peke yake, akiwa na tamaa ya kupata \"kuishi\" nzuri kutoka kwa ushawishi wa Hekaluni au Hekaluni. Kuna uvumi juu ya nini kilisababisha ugomvi kati ya Swift na mwajiri wake, lakini, kama A. C. Elias anashangaza, inaonekana kwamba majani ya mwisho yalikuja na kazi ya Swift kwenye \"Barua\" za Hekaluni. Swift alikuwa ameshirikiana kutafsiri mawasiliano ya Ufaransa ya Hekaluni, lakini hekalu, au mtu aliye karibu na hekalu, alihariri maandishi ya Ufaransa ili kufanya hekalu ionekane ya kitabia na ya ufasaha zaidi. Kwa hivyo, barua na tafsiri Swift zilizotolewa hazikufanya, na, kwa kuwa Swift hakuweza kushtaki Hekaluni kwa kuiba barua zake, na kwa sababu umma hautawahi kuamini kwamba waziri wa serikali aliyestaafu alikuwa amesema uwongo, Swift aligundua kuwa hana uwezo.\nHata ingawa Swift alichapisha \"hadithi\" wakati alipoacha huduma ya Hekalu, ilichukuliwa mapema, na kitabu hicho ni salvo katika moja ya vita vya Hekaluni. Polemic ya jumla ya Swift inahusu hoja (\"ugomvi wa watu wa zamani na wa kisasa\") ambayo ilikuwa imekwisha kwa karibu miaka kumi na wakati kitabu kilichapishwa. \"Ugomvi wa watu wa zamani na wa kisasa\" ulikuwa mjadala wa kitaaluma wa Ufaransa wa miaka ya 1690, ulisababisha Fontenelle akisema kwamba usomi wa kisasa ulimruhusu mwanadamu wa kisasa kuzidi wazee katika maarifa. Hekalu liligombana dhidi ya msimamo huu katika \"juu ya ujifunzaji wake wa zamani na wa kisasa\" (ambapo alitoa muundo wa kwanza wa Kiingereza wa mahali pa kawaida kwamba wakosoaji wa kisasa wanaona tu kwa sababu ni vibanda vilivyosimama juu ya mabega ya makubwa), na insha ya Hekalu isiyo na maana ilisababisha majibu madogo. Kati ya wengine, watu wawili ambao walichukua upande wa kupinga hekalu walikuwa Richard Bentley (mtaalam na mhariri) na William Wotton (mkosoaji).\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Where was Jonathan Swift born?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, on 30 November 1667 ["}

The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species, and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species. Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex, while other axons terminate in the pretectal nucleus and are involved in reflexive eye movements. Other axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. Its diameter increases from about 1.6 mm within the eye to 3.5 mm in the orbit to 4.5 mm within the cranial space. The optic nerve component lengths are 1 mm in the globe, 24 mm in the orbit, 9 mm in the optic canal, and 16 mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm.

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from spontaneous generation.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Chuo Kikuu cha Toronto\nContent: Ugunduzi wa insulini katika Chuo Kikuu cha Toronto mnamo 1921 unazingatiwa kati ya matukio muhimu zaidi katika historia ya dawa. Kiini cha shina kiligunduliwa katika Chuo Kikuu mnamo 1963, na kutengeneza msingi wa kupandikiza kwa mfupa na utafiti wote wa baadaye juu ya seli za shina za watu wazima na embryonic. Hii ilikuwa ya kwanza ya matokeo mengi huko Toronto yanayohusiana na seli za shina, pamoja na kitambulisho cha seli za kongosho na shina. Kiini cha saratani kilitambuliwa kwanza mnamo 1997 na watafiti wa Toronto, ambao wamepata vyama vya seli za shina katika leukemia, tumors za ubongo na saratani ya colorectal. Uvumbuzi wa matibabu ulioandaliwa huko Toronto ni pamoja na faharisi ya glycemic, pablum ya nafaka ya watoto, matumizi ya hypothermia ya kinga katika upasuaji wa moyo wazi na pacemaker ya kwanza ya moyo. Upandikizaji wa kwanza wa mapafu moja ulifanywa huko Toronto mnamo 1981, ikifuatiwa na upandikizaji wa kwanza wa ujasiri mnamo 1988, na upandikizaji wa kwanza wa mapafu mara mbili mnamo 1989. Watafiti waligundua sababu ya kukuza kukomaa ambayo inasimamia mgawanyiko wa seli, na kugundua receptor ya T-seli, ambayo husababisha majibu ya mfumo wa kinga. Chuo kikuu kinapewa sifa ya kutenganisha jeni inayosababisha anemia ya Fanconi, cystic fibrosis na ugonjwa wa alzheimer wa mapema, kati ya magonjwa mengine mengi. Kati ya 1914 na 1972, Chuo Kikuu kiliendesha Maabara ya Utafiti wa Matibabu ya Connaught, ambayo sasa ni sehemu ya Shirika la Madawa Sanofi-Aventis. Kati ya utafiti uliofanywa katika maabara ni maendeleo ya electrophoresis ya gel.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who first identified the cell?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Robert Hooke is credited as the first person to identify and describe cells, a discovery he made in the 17th century after improvements in microscope technology allowed him to observe the microscopic structure of cork and coin the term “cell” for the box-like structures he saw ["}

One proposed explanation for this dearth of cloud features is that Uranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low internal thermal flux. Why Uranus's heat flux is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun. Uranus, by contrast, radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere. In fact, Uranus's heat flux is only  W/m², which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 0.075 W/m².

Under the lords were other subjects such as serfs, who were bound and obliged to their lords, and to their lords' obligations. Merchants had a special status in the system, as did Jews. Jews were declared to be direct subjects of the king, unlike the rest of the population. This was an ambivalent legal position for the Jewish population, in that they were not tied to any particular lord but were subject to the whims of the king, it could be either advantageous or disadvantageous. Every successive king formally reviewed a royal charter, granting Jews the right to remain in England.

Bahati kubwa za Kiyahudi zilitengenezwa London, Oxford, Lincoln, Bristol, na Norwich. Taji, kwa upande wake, ilipewa ustawi wa Wayahudi wake. Mbali na ushuru mwingi wa kiholela, Richard I alianzisha agizo la Uyahudi mnamo 1194 katika jaribio la kuandaa Jumuiya ya Wayahudi. Ilihakikisha kuwa rekodi za lazima zitahifadhiwa na maafisa wa kifalme kwa shughuli zote za Kiyahudi. Kila deni lilirekodiwa kwenye chirografia ili kumruhusu Mfalme mara moja na ufikiaji kamili wa mali ya Kiyahudi. Richard pia alianzisha exchequer maalum kukusanya deni yoyote isiyolipwa baada ya kifo cha mkopeshaji wa Kiyahudi. Uanzishwaji wa exchequer ya Wayahudi mwishowe ulifanya shughuli zote za Uyahudi wa Kiingereza kuwajibika kwa ushuru na mfalme kwa kuongeza 10% ya hesabu zote zilizopatikana na Wayahudi kwa msaada wa mahakama za Kiingereza. Kwa hivyo, wakati vita vya kwanza na vya pili viliongezea hisia za kupinga-Wayahudi, Wayahudi huko England walikwenda bila shida zaidi ya faini ya mara kwa mara na ushuru maalum. Ingawa hawakupata uzoefu huo wa uhamaji wa kijamii na maendeleo ya kitamaduni ambayo Wayahudi chini ya utawala wa Waislamu walifanya, Wayahudi wa idadi ya watu wa England na ustawi waliongezeka chini ya ulinzi wa mfalme.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When did Jewish people first come to England?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jewish people first arrived in England in significant numbers in 1066, accompanying William the Conqueror after his Norman invasion and establishment of rule over the country ["}

In 1870, he was one of numerous Southern black migrants to Boston, Massachusetts, which had a thriving black community and strong abolitionist history. He later joined the Republican Party that was founded by abolitionists, and Chappelle was elected to two terms in the Massachusetts state legislature, serving 1883-1886. Julius Caesar Chappelle was also the first African-American to serve on the Massachusetts State Senate Committee where he served three terms. Chappelle was active in supporting civil rights, trying to reduce discrimination, and consumer affairs. His speeches were frequently covered by newspapers. Throughout his life and political career, he held secondary supervisory government positions in maintenance, such as at the United States Post Office and US Boston Custom House.

Vigilante activities continued, although somewhat sporadically, through the Montana Territorial period until the territory became the state of Montana on November 8, 1889. Vigilantism arose because territorial law enforcement and the courts had very little power in the remote mining camps during the territorial period.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Montana Vigilantes\nContent: Akaunti ya kwanza iliyoandikwa ya The Vigilantes ilikuwa \"Vigilantes ya Montana\" ambayo ilionekana kama safu ya makala katika matoleo ya 1865 ya \"Montana Post\", gazeti la kwanza la Virginia City na Montana. Dimsdale alikuwa mwanachama wa Kamati ya Uangalizi ya Alder Gulch na mhariri wa \"Montana Post.\" Akaunti zake za mapema za hafla za Alder Gulch Vigilante zimetajwa sana na toleo la kitabu cha nakala zake, kitabu cha kwanza kilichochapishwa katika eneo la Montana mnamo 1866, kimechapishwa sana tangu toleo lake la kwanza. X. Biedler, mmoja wa Alder Gulch na Helena Vigilante Enforcers aliandika juu ya shughuli zake za macho katika majarida yake ya kibinafsi. Hawakupatikana hadi baada ya kifo chake wakati Helen F. Sanders, binti-mkwe wa Wilbur Sanders hatimaye alipochapishwa mnamo 1957. Nathaniel Langford, pia mwanachama wa Vigilantes, Explorer wa Upper Yellowstone (1870), Msimamizi wa kwanza wa Hifadhi ya Kitaifa ya Yellowstone (1872-1877). \"Siku za Vigilante na Njia za Waanzilishi wa Rockies\" mnamo 1893 baada ya kurudi nyumbani kwake Minnesota. Katika hotuba ya 1912 kwa Jumuiya ya Kihistoria ya Montana, mwanahistoria wa Magharibi, Olin Wheeler alitoa maoni mazuri juu ya Alder Gulch Vigilantes katika ushuru wa maisha ya Nathaniel Langford. Akaunti nyingine, ambayo haijachapishwa hadi 1982, ni ile ya Jaji wa zamani wa Mahakama Kuu ya Montana (1922-1935) Lew L. Callaway. Ilihaririwa na mtoto wake Lew Callaway Jr., \"Haki ya Haki ya Montana: Vigilantes in Action\" inatokana na ushirika wa Callaway na Nahodha wa Vigilante James William mwishoni mwa miaka ya 1800. Lew Callaway aliandika sana juu ya Vigilantes na hadithi zake ambazo zinaongeza maelezo ya karibu zaidi juu ya jinsi vigilantes inavyofanya kazi hutekwa kwa kiasi hiki. Ingawa shughuli zingine za macho katika kipindi hiki zilikosolewa na raia na viongozi wa raia, kulikuwa na uthibitisho wa jumla wa kusudi lao na mchango kwa sheria na utaratibu katika eneo linalokua. Alama C. \"Montana Vigilantes 1863-1870 dhahabu, bunduki na gallows\" (2013) anahitimisha kwamba ilitoa mazingira yasiyokuwa na sheria na shughuli za uhalifu huko Alder Gulch na Helena wakati huo, ukosefu wa mfumo wowote wa haki na uelewa wa mchakato unaofaa wakati huo, Vigilantes walitenda kwa njia walidhani bora kwa mawasiliano yao. Anasema kwamba kuhukumu macho kwa uelewa wa leo na viwango vya mchakato unaofaa ni shida. Mnamo 2004, Frederick Allen, mwandishi wa habari na mwanahistoria, alichapisha \"heshima na mpangilio mzuri: Montana Vigilantes\" ilipitiwa kama akaunti ya siku ya usawa ya historia ya Montana ya Vigilante (1864-1870). Kitabu cha Allen kinasisitiza motisha na njia za waangalifu wa mapema huko Alder Gulch wakati wa kutoa maoni juu ya udhalilishaji unaokua wa umakini wa miaka ya 1860. Jenerali zaidi anafanya kazi kwenye historia ya Montana kama vile Merrill G. Burlingame's \"Montana Frontier\" (1942) na Michael P. Malone's \"Historia ya Montana-A ya karne mbili\" (1991) inafupisha kwa muhtasari kipindi cha Vigilante kwa msingi wa akaunti za Dimsdale, Langford na Biedler. Kwa kuongezea, historia nyingi za juu za Montana, kama vile mwandishi wa riwaya na mwanahistoria wa Montana Dan Cushman's \"Montana: The Gold Frontier\" (1973) hushughulikia kipindi cha Vigilante.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was the Montana Vigilantes formed?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The Montana Vigilantes were formed in 1863, when the mining camps of what was then eastern Idaho Territory lacked effective legal authority ["}

He also worked on methods of detecting submarines during World War I. He applied for the first patent on a seismic exploration method in 1914, which was issued in 1917. Due to the war, he was unable to follow up on the idea. John Clarence Karcher discovered seismic reflections independently while working for the United States Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) on methods of sound ranging to detect artillery. In discussion with colleagues, the idea developed that these reflections could aid in exploration for petroleum. With several others, many affiliated with the University of Oklahoma, Karcher helped to form the Geological Engineering Company, incorporated in Oklahoma in April, 1920. The first field tests were conducted near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1921.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Tafakari ya Seismology\nContent: Tafakari ya Seismology (au Tafakari ya Seismic) ni njia ya utafutaji wa jiografia ambayo hutumia kanuni za seismolojia kukadiria mali ya subsurface ya Dunia kutoka kwa mawimbi ya seismic yaliyoonyeshwa.

Legend claims that Rugby football was started around the time of 1845 in Rugby School, Rugby, Warwickshire, England, although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times. Rugby eventually split into two sports in 1895 when twenty one clubs split from the original Rugby Football Union, to form the Northern Union (later to be named rugby league in 1922) in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, Northern England over the issue of payment to players, thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay its players, rugby union turned fully professional in 1995. Both sports are run by their respective world governing bodies World Rugby (rugby union) and the Rugby League International Federation (rugby league). Rugby football was one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports.

His nine year gap between his first and second World Championships is tied with Ted Hankey for the longest gap between World Championships, and his third triumph in 2008 saw him become the first player in history to win a world title in three different venues, and the first to win at the Alexandra Palace. His 2008 win saw him join Phil Taylor, Eric Bristow, Raymond van Barneveld and John Lowe as the only players with three or more World Championships, and become only the second player (after Taylor) to win multiple PDC titles.

While the U.S. switchover deadline of 17 February was later pushed back to 12 June 2009 and only applied to American-licensed stations in any case, plans were announced to voluntarily make the station's English-language programming digital-only. The analog signal would be repurposed to retransmit the Mexican Galavisión network (not to be confused with the American cable channel of the same name). Claims on XETV's website that the station was indeed going to transmit a digitally-exclusive signal were rescinded on 17 February 2009 as the station decided to delay cutting off its analog signal until after it secured approval from the Mexican government. XETV management later stated that it had decided to maintain its analog signal to benefit Mexican viewers. XETV's analog signal was eventually repurposed on 5 March 2012, when the station began multicasting on its digital signal with the addition of Televisa's youth-oriented Canal 5 network on subchannel 6.2 and on its analog feed, while digital channel 6.1 retained the newscasts, CW network and syndicated programs in English. On the same date, XHBJ-TV channel 45 dropped Canal 5 for Galavisión. Canal 5 replaced XETV's English-language programming on its analog signal, in order to serve Spanish-speaking viewers in Tijuana that did not have television sets with built-in digital tuners or digital converter boxes prior to the Tijuana market's 2013 transition to digital television. The affiliation switch coincided with the commencement of digital multicasting on Televisa's Tijuana stations. Canal 5 moved to its primary channel on 31 May 2017, at which point, the 6.2 subchannel was decommissioned.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: XETV-TDT\nContent: Kwa sababu XETV-TDT ina leseni ya Tijuana na serikali ya Mexico, haijafunikwa chini ya FCC lazima ichukue sheria.

Consequently, the new carriers never went to sea with a full air group. This left the Japanese with a ragtag collection of carriers, led by the \"Zuikaku\", which was the sole survivor of the Pearl Harbor attack force. The Japanese were left with two choices, either to commit their remaining strength in an all-out offensive, or to sit by while the Americans occupied the Philippines and cut the sea lanes between Japan and vital resources from the Dutch East Indies and Malaya. The plan devised by the Japanese was a final attempt to create a decisive battle by utilizing their last remaining strength, the firepower of its heavy cruisers and battleships, which were to be all committed against the American beachhead at Leyte.

Mwisho wake gizani, Bilbo alikubali mchezo wa kitendawili na Gollum kwenye nafasi ya kuonyeshwa njia ya kutoka milimani. Katika toleo la kwanza la \"The Hobbit\", saizi ya Gollum haijaelezewa. Ni katika toleo lililorekebishwa tu ambalo limetajwa kuwa yeye ni mdogo na kwa kweli ni Hobbit isiyo ya kawaida.

Ili kutoshea wazo la pete ya kutawala ambayo iliibuka wakati wa uandishi wa \"Bwana wa pete\", Tolkien alirekebisha matoleo ya baadaye ya \"The Hobbit\": toleo la hadithi lililotolewa katika toleo la kwanza likawa uwongo ambao Bilbo alifanya kuhalalisha milki yake ya pete kwa vibanda na Gandalf. Katika toleo jipya Gollum alijifanya angeonyesha Bilbo njia ya kutoka ikiwa atapoteza mchezo wa kitendawili, lakini kwa kweli alipanga kutumia pete kuua na kula hobbit. Kugundua pete haipo, ghafla aligundua jibu la kitendawili cha mwisho cha Bilbo - \"Nimepata nini mfukoni mwangu?\" - na akaruka kwa hasira. Bilbo aligundua kwa nguvu nguvu ya pete ya kutoonekana wakati anakimbia, na kumruhusu kufuata Gollum bila kutambuliwa kwa mlango wa nyuma wa mapango. Gollum alikuwa ameshawishika kwamba Bilbo alijua njia ya nje wakati wote, na alitarajia kumkataza karibu na mlango, isije goblins kumkamata Bilbo na kupata pete. Mwanzoni Bilbo alifikiria kumuua Gollum ili kutoroka, lakini alishikwa na huruma, na kwa hivyo akaruka juu yake tu. Kama Bilbo alitoroka, Gollum alilia, \"Mwizi, mwizi, mwizi! Baggins!

The series is produced by Proper Television, whose president, Guy O'Sullivan, was the director of the original \"Britain's Worst Driver\" series until its cancellation in 2003. O'Sullivan served as executive producer of \"Canada's Worst Driver\" until his death in April 2017, doubling as executive producer of sister series \"Canada's Worst Handyman\" until its cancellation in 2011.
