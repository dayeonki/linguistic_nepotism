The partition took place on 16 October 1905 and separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas. The former province of Bengal was divided into two new provinces \"Bengal\" (comprising western Bengal as well as the province of Bihar and Orissa) and Eastern Bengal and Assam with Dacca as the capital of the latter. Partition was promoted for administrative reasons: Bengal was geographically as large as France and had a significantly larger population. Curzon stated the eastern region was neglected and under-governed. By splitting the province, an improved administration could be established in the east, where subsequently, the population would benefit from new schools and employment opportunities. The Hindus of West Bengal who dominated Bengal's business and rural life complained that the division would make them a minority in a province that would incorporate the province of Bihar and Orissa. Indians were outraged at what they recognised as a \"divide and rule\" policy.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How large is Bengal by area?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Bengal spans a total area of about 232,752 square kilometres, a territory that collectively includes the Indian state of West Bengal and the independent nation of Bangladesh ["}

One stained-glass window, \"The Flight into Egypt\", was spared destruction due to being in Connecticut for repair. The third Notre Dame was designed and built around this window. The three Angels that had adorned the Sanctuary Lamp and two candlesticks, though in the middle of the blaze, managed to survive the inferno. These too are part of the new church. The Sacred Heart Monument also miraculously survived the blaze even though it was in close proximity to the church. It wasn't until 1986 that the new church was built and ready for use. The orientation of the new building is reverse what the old one was. The new churches \"front\" sits in the footprint of the old churches \"rear\". In 2012, it was revealed that the parish of Notre Dame de Lourdes would be merging with the parish of Immaculate Conception in Fall River.

Hamilton recognized that a large sector of this range contained distinctive granitic rocks like South Australia's Adelaide orogenic belt. Associated fossils of diverse ages in Antarctica, Australia, and southernmost Africa further linked these continents, and supported then-radical explanations of continental drift. Before traveling to Antarctica, Hamilton was what he later described as a \"closet drifter,\" aware that Southern Hemisphere geology provided powerful evidence favoring continental drift.

Bullock's department store in Los Angeles, California, sold out of its first, 100-copy order of the book in a day and quickly reordered 250 more. The Morgans attribute these sales numbers to \"playground word-of-mouth\", asserting that children heard about the book from their friends and nagged their parents to buy it for them. However, Houghton Mifflin's school edition did not sell as well. As Geisel noted in Jonathan Cott's 1983 profile of him, \"Houghton Mifflin... had trouble selling it to the schools; there were a lot of Dick and Jane devotees, and my book was considered too fresh and irreverent.

If the new encounter does not coincide with their preexisting assumptions, then dissonance is likely to occur. When dissonance does occur, individuals are motivated to reduce the dissonance they experience by avoiding situations that would either cause the dissonance or increase the dissonance.

They may experience dissonance between their beliefs and their actions. If there is a significant amount of dissonance, they may be motivated to change their attitudes and work out more or eat healthier foods. They may also be inclined to avoid situations that will point out the fact that their attitudes and beliefs are inconsistent, such as avoiding the gym or not reading health reports.According to cognitive dissonance theory, there are three types of cognitive relationships: consonant relationships, dissonant relationships, and irrelevant relationships. Consonant relationships are when two elements, such as your beliefs and actions, are in equilibrium with each other or coincide. Dissonant relationships are when two elements are not in equilibrium and cause dissonance.

In his early years Chamberlain was not interested in basketball, because he thought it was \"a game for sissies\". Instead, he was an avid track and field athlete: as a youth, he high jumped 6 feet, 6 inches, ran the 440 yards in 49.0 seconds and the 880 yards in 1:58.3, put the shot 53 feet, 4 inches, and broad jumped 22 feet. But according to Chamberlain, \"basketball was king in Philadelphia\", so he eventually turned to the sport. Because Chamberlain was a very tall child, already measuring at age 10 and when he entered Philadelphia's Overbrook High School, he had a natural advantage against his peers; he soon was renowned for his scoring talent, his physical strength and his shot blocking abilities. According to ESPN journalist Hal Bock, Chamberlain was \"scary, flat-out frightening... before he came along, most basketball players were mortal-sized men. Chamberlain changed that.\" It was also in this period of his life when his three lifelong nicknames \"Wilt the Stilt\", \"Goliath\", and his favorite, \"The Big Dipper\", were allegedly born.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When did Wilton Norman Chamberlain die?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Wilton Norman Chamberlain died on October 12, 1999 ["}

Triple XS walikuwa nyuma kwenye nembo ya kampuni na walitumiwa karibu na matangazo yote ya Pearl. XS ilishikilia jukumu hili muhimu hadi mwisho wa uzalishaji katika biashara ya pombe mnamo 2001, wakati kampuni ya biashara ya biashara ilifunga milango yake na nembo ya kampuni iliachwa.

In the 1960s, Pearl absorbed the Goetz Brewing Company and made Country Club Malt Liquor one of Pearl's key products.

Kuna axioms nyingi katika utengenezaji wa meno ambayo lazima ieleweke; Ujinga wa axiom moja inaweza kusababisha kutofaulu kwa denture. Katika idadi kubwa ya visa, meno kamili yanapaswa kuwa vizuri mara baada ya kuingizwa, ingawa karibu kila wakati angalau ziara mbili za marekebisho ni muhimu kuondoa sababu ya matangazo ya kidonda. Mojawapo ya mambo muhimu zaidi ya meno ni kwamba hisia za meno lazima zifanywe kikamilifu na kutumiwa na mbinu kamili ya kutengeneza mfano sahihi wa ufizi wa mgonjwa (toothless). Daktari wa meno au meno lazima atumie mchakato unaoitwa ukingo wa mpaka ili kuhakikisha kuwa flange za meno zinapanuliwa vizuri. Safu ya shida inaweza kutokea ikiwa maoni ya mwisho ya denture hayafanywa vizuri. Inachukua uvumilivu mkubwa na uzoefu kwa daktari wa meno kujua jinsi ya kutengeneza denture, na kwa sababu hii inaweza kuwa katika shauku bora ya mgonjwa kutafuta mtaalam, ama mtaalam wa densi au denturist, kutengeneza denture. Denturist ni mtaalamu aliyefundishwa na mwenye leseni ambaye huwaona wagonjwa wanaohitaji meno, sehemu, huelekeza au matengenezo. Denturist sio tu inachukua hisia, lakini hufanya denture nzima katika maabara yake mwenyewe. Denturist basi hupanga tarehe ya utoaji wa meno ya kumaliza kwa mgonjwa. Daktari wa meno ya jumla anaweza kufanya kazi nzuri kutengeneza meno, lakini tu ikiwa yeye ni mwenye uangalifu na mwenye uzoefu. Madaktari wa meno wengi hawafanyi meno tena. lakini badala yake chukua hisia za mdomo wa wagonjwa na kisha utumie maoni kwa maabara ya meno, ambayo inaweza kuwa mahali popote ulimwenguni, au kutuma mgonjwa kwa denturist. Mara tu maabara inapopokea hisia za meno ya mdomo wa mgonjwa, maabara huunda umbo la plaster kutoka kwao. Maabara hutumia ukungu kuunda miiba ya nta inayotumika kusajili kuumwa kwa mgonjwa. Rims hizi za nta zinarudishwa kwa daktari wa meno, ambaye Inawatumia kusajili kuumwa kwa mgonjwa. Daktari wa meno anaweza kumsaidia mgonjwa katika kuchagua saizi sahihi ya meno kwa meno, au tu kufanya uteuzi mwenyewe. Mara tu usajili wa bite ukikamilika na meno huchaguliwa kwa meno, mdomo wa nta kawaida hurejeshwa kwa maabara ya meno ili meno ya meno iwe ndani ya nta. Mara meno yamewekwa ndani ya mdomo wa nta, matokeo yake ni denture iliyowekwa tayari ambayo inaonekana kama bidhaa iliyomalizika. Denture hii iliyotanguliwa kawaida hurejeshwa katika ofisi ya daktari wa meno na mgonjwa kawaida huwa na nafasi ya kupitisha usanidi (kwa meno ya haraka au ya kawaida) au kujaribu meno kabla ya kumaliza. Baada ya idhini ya mgonjwa, daktari wa meno anarudisha densi ya mapema kwa maabara kwa usindikaji wa mwisho. Denture iliyokamilishwa basi inarudishwa katika ofisi ya daktari wa meno kwa kujifungua kwa mgonjwa.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Denture cleaner\nContent: A denture cleaner (also termed denture cleanser), is a cleaner used to clean dentures when they are out of the mouth. Their main use is to control the growth of microorganisms on the dentures, especially \"Candida albicans\", thereby preventing denture-related stomatitis. When dentures are worn in the mouth, a biofilm develops which may be similar to dental plaque. It may become hardened and mineralized as dental calculus. Denture cleansers are also used to remove stains and other debris that may be caused by diet, tobacco use, drinking coffee, drinking tea, etc.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is a denture specialist called?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: A specialist who focuses on the design, fabrication, and fitting of complete or partial dentures is commonly called a prosthodontist or, in jurisdictions where they are licensed, a denturist; both professionals possess advanced training specifically aimed at producing comfortable, functional dentures and managing related oral-rehabilitation issues ["}

They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of the cubs varies – sometimes a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.\nWeaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest. When one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. Females often fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the male. Cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. Up to 80% of lion cubs will die before the age of two.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Why do lions kill their own cubs?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Male–lion infanticide occurs chiefly when a new dominant male or coalition takes over a pride; by killing nursing cubs that are not his, he removes future rivals and, crucially, causes the mothers to stop lactating and return to estrus sooner, giving him an earlier chance to mate and pass on his own genes, so the behavior is favored by natural selection and persists in the population ["}

Dawa maalum mara nyingi ni biolojia - \"dawa zinazotokana na seli hai\" ambazo zinaweza kuingizwa au kuingizwa (ingawa zingine ni dawa za mdomo). Zinatumika kutibu hali ngumu au adimu kama saratani, ugonjwa wa arheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, H.I.V. Psoriasis, ugonjwa wa matumbo ya uchochezi na hepatitis C. Mnamo 1990 kulikuwa na dawa maalum za soko, katikati ya miaka ya 1990 kulikuwa na chini ya 30, kufikia 2008 kulikuwa na 200, na kufikia 2015 kulikuwa na dawa 300. Mara nyingi hufafanuliwa kama utaalam kwa sababu bei yao ni kubwa zaidi kuliko ile ya dawa zisizo za utambuzi. Medicare inafafanua dawa yoyote ambayo bei iliyojadiliwa ni $ 670 kwa mwezi au zaidi, kama dawa maalum ambayo imewekwa kwenye tier maalum ambayo inahitaji kugawana gharama ya mgonjwa. Dawa za kulevya pia zinatambuliwa kama maalum wakati kuna mahitaji maalum ya utunzaji au dawa inapatikana tu kupitia mtandao mdogo wa usambazaji.

Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various Māori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving Māori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from Māori to Pākehā (European) ownership, and most Māori subsequently became impoverished.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was New Zealand first settled?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Archaeological and traditional evidence indicate that the first human settlement of New Zealand occurred when Polynesian ancestors of the Māori arrived between AD 1280 and 1320, marking the beginning of continuous habitation in the islands ["}

In addition, Takahashi emphasized that neither Jesus Christ nor Gotama Siddhartha preached the thoughts of other powers at all, and that Christianity and Buddhism in their respective times were not complicated like the Christianity and Buddhism of today. With regard to the thoughts of other powers influencing these religions, these laws of nature (the pure religious base of Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity) transformed as a result of the intentions of those who were in power over time, as well as the interpretations of the many scholars; the cores of these laws of nature were lost, various theories became mixed, and they became academized in a complex manner and lost their substance. In addition, these laws of nature were intentionally distorted and conveyed to people for the purpose of individual's own benefit, and people were made to believe that those who obstructed this would be met with strict counteractions.

In response to this, he advocated returning to the times of Gotama Siddhartha and Jesus Christ in many of his literary works, starting with “\"Ningen/Shaka\"” (“Human Beings/Gotama Buddha”). In addition, Takahashi emphasized that neither Jesus Christ nor Gotama Siddhartha preached the thoughts of other powers at all, and that Christianity and Buddhism in their respective times were not complicated like the Christianity and Buddhism of today. With regard to the thoughts of other powers influencing these religions, these laws of nature (the pure religious base of Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity) transformed as a result of the intentions of those who were in power over time, as well as the interpretations of the many scholars; the cores of these laws of nature were lost, various theories became mixed, and they became academized in a complex manner and lost their substance. In addition, these laws of nature were intentionally distorted and conveyed to people for the purpose of individual's own benefit, and people were made to believe that those who obstructed this would be met with strict counteractions. This new set of distorted laws were slowly deemed as being the laws of nature as taught in today's versions of those religions.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Does Buddhism believe in Jesus?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: While Christianity places monotheism and the crucifixion of Jesus, viewed as the once-for-all atonement for sin, at the center of faith, these concepts have no doctrinal counterpart in Buddhism, whose teachings focus instead on personal karma, the Four Noble Truths, and the Eightfold Path ["}

At the time Everton Football Club were looking for a flagpole for their Anfield ground, and consequently purchased her top mast. It still stands there today at the ground - now owned by Liverpool Football Club (formed 1892), at the Kop end.

The publication of the work coincided with Swift's striking out on his own, having despaired of getting a good \"living\" from Temple or Temple's influence. There is speculation about what caused the rift between Swift and his employer, but, as A. C. Elias persuasively argues, it seems that the final straw came with Swift's work on Temple's \"Letters.\" Swift had been engaged to translate Temple's French correspondence, but Temple, or someone close to Temple, edited the French text to make Temple seem both prescient and more fluent. Consequently, the letters and the translations Swift provided did not gibe, and, since Swift could not accuse Temple of falsifying his letters, and because the public would never believe that the retired state minister had lied, Swift came across as incompetent.\nEven though Swift published the \"Tale\" as he left Temple's service, it was conceived earlier, and the book is a salvo in one of Temple's battles. Swift's general polemic concerns an argument (the \"Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns\") that had been over for nearly ten years by the time the book was published. The \"Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns\" was a French academic debate of the early 1690s, occasioned by Fontenelle arguing that modern scholarship had allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge. Temple argued against this position in his \"On Ancient and Modern Learning\" (where he provided the first English formulation of the commonplace that modern critics see more only because they are dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants), and Temple's somewhat naive essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were Richard Bentley (classicist and editor) and William Wotton (critic).\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Where was Jonathan Swift born?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, on 30 November 1667 ["}

As a consequence, the fibers of the optic nerve are covered with myelin produced by oligodendrocytes, rather than Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system, and are encased within the meninges. Peripheral neuropathies like Guillain–Barré syndrome do not affect the optic nerve.

Montagu presented a unique theory for his time: \"in biology race is defined as a subdivision of species which inherits physical characteristics distinguishing it from other populations of the species. In this sense there are many human 'races.' But this is not the sense in which many anthropologists, race-classifiers, and racists have used the term.\" He admits that in a biological sense, there is the existence of races within mankind. However, he also believes that not all of mankind can be classified. Part of his reasoning has to do with mixed origin, which has resulted in “overlapping” of physicalities. Instead of races and subspecies, he prefers mixed ethnic groups. His writing further emphasizes the complexity of our descent and rejects claims that support one race being superior when compared to others. He also says profoundly that the \"so-called\" main divisions of mankind are species instead of races.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Which race has the most people?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The race (ethnic group) with the greatest number of people is the Han Chinese, recognized as the world’s largest ethnic group; their predominant tongue, Mandarin, is likewise the most spoken native language globally ["}

Initially, he determined there should be a community of Benedictine monks at the new cathedral, performing the liturgies and singing the daily Office. This caused great resentment amongst the secular clergy of the diocese, who felt they were being snubbed. In the end, negotiations with both the English Benedictines and the community of French Benedictines at Farnborough failed and a 'traditional' choir of men and boys was set up instead. Despite great financial problems, the Choir School opened on 5 October 1901 with eleven boy choristers, in the building originally intended for the Benedictine monks. Cardinal Vaughan received the boys with the words \"You are the foundation stones\". The Cathedral Choir was officially instituted three months later in January 1902. Sung Masses and Offices were immediately established when the cathedral opened for worship in 1903, and have continued without interruption ever since. Today, Westminster Cathedral Choir is the only professional Catholic choir in the world to sing daily Mass and Vespers.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who designed Westminster Cathedral?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Westminster Cathedral was designed by the English architect John Francis Bentley, who is also credited with designing the building of Sacred Heart High School in Hammersmith ["}

The exception is Lake Kivu, which is part of the present-day Congo River basin, but is believed to have been connected to Lakes Edward and Victoria by rivers until the uplifting of parts of the East African Rift. This deep lake may have functioned as an \"evolutionary reservoir\" for this haplochromine group in periods where other shallower lakes in the region dried out, as happened to Lake Victoria about 15,000 years ago. In recent history only Lake Kyoga was easily accessible to Victoria cichlids, as further downstream movement by the Victoria Nile (to Lake Albert) is prevented by a series of waterfalls, notably Murchison. In contrast, the Owen Falls (now flooded by a dam) between Victoria and Kyoga were essentially a series of rapids that did not effectively block fish movements between the two lakes.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How deep is Lake Victoria?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Lake Victoria is comparatively shallow for one of the African Great Lakes, attaining a maximum depth of about 80 m, with its average depth noted as significantly less (exact figure not specified in the source) ["}

The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T-cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis.

The fault is on the boundary of four major geologic provinces: the Basin and Range, Idaho-Wyoming Thrust belt, Rocky Mountain Foreland, and the Yellowstone volcanic plateau. The Basin and Range province is a region of east-west crustal extension. This province adds tension perpendicular to the fault line causing the fault blocks to move apart. The Idaho-Wyoming Thrust belt is located south of the Teton fault and is a region of thick and deformed crust that prevents the fault from extending farther south. The Rocky Mountain Foreland is located east of the Teton fault and is a region of thicker crust. This section of crust is heavier and adds to the vertical downward force on the hanging wall of fault. The Yellowstone volcanic plateau is a region of uplift and expansion that influences both vertical and horizontal forces on the Teton fault.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Where is the fault line for Hawaii located?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Hawaii’s principal surface fault line is the Koa‘e Fault Zone on Kīlauea Volcano, a 12-kilometre-long series of east-northeast–trending fault scarps that links Kīlauea’s East Rift Zone near Pauahi Crater to its Southwest Rift Zone close to Mauna Iki on the Island of Hawai‘i; the zone is about 2 kilometres wide in the north-south direction and has been active for tens of thousands of years ["}

While traveling under the aegis of the Curtis Institute, he briefly played a loaned Stradivarius, which was exchanged for a Januarius Gagliano. In 1929 Temianka owned the violin made in 1752 by Joannes Baptista Guadagnini. In the 1930s he played a Silvestre violin, with which he made his early Vintage recordings, and subsequently a Januarius Gagliano and a Carlo Bergonzi.\nThe Stradivarius he played during the years of the Paganini Quartet was the \"Comte Cozio di Salabue\" of 1727, which was Paganini's own concert violin. It was later played by Martin Beaver, first violinist of the Tokyo String Quartet, which played since 1995 on the same quartet of Stradivarius instruments once owned by Paganini, until the Tokyo String Quartet retired in July 2013. These remarkable instruments—the viola had inspired Paganini to commission Hector Berlioz's \"Harold en Italie\"—were also played by the Cleveland Quartet for almost 15 years, beginning in 1982, and are presently owned by Nippon Music Foundation of Japan, after deacquisition by the Corcoran Gallery in the mid-1990s for $15 million. They were then played for several years by the Hagen Quartet, and are now in the hands of the Quartetto di Cremona.\nWhen the years of the Paganini Quartet came to an end, Temianka played a Michelangelo Bergonzi of 1759. His recordings of the Handel Sonatas were made on an Andrea Guarneri of 1687.In February 2013, Chapman University endowed the Henri Temianka Professorship in Music and Scholarship in String Studies.

Major Jewish fortunes were made in London, Oxford, Lincoln, Bristol, and Norwich. The Crown, in turn, capitalized on the prosperity of its Jews. In addition to many arbitrary taxes, Richard I established the Ordinance of the Jewry in 1194 in an attempt to organize the Jewish community. It ensured that mandatory records would be kept by royal officials for all Jewish transactions. Every debt was recorded on a chirography to allow the king immediate and complete access to Jewish property. Richard also established a special exchequer to collect any unpaid debts due after the death of a Jewish creditor. The establishment of the Exchequer of the Jews eventually made all transactions of the English Jewry liable to taxation by the king in addition to the 10% of all sums recovered by Jews with the help of English courts. So, while the First and Second Crusades increased anti-Jewish sentiments, Jews in England went relatively unscathed beyond occasional fines and special levies. Though they did not experience the same kind of social mobility and cultural advancements that Jews under Muslim rule did, the Jews of England's population and prosperity increased under the protection of the king.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When did Jewish people first come to England?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jewish people first arrived in England in significant numbers in 1066, accompanying William the Conqueror after his Norman invasion and establishment of rule over the country ["}

The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215).

A February 1978 cover story for the British teen magazine \"Jackie\" included step-by-step instructions on how to replicate Leia's hair buns. In the 1978 short film parody \"Hardware Wars\", Princess Anne-Droid has actual cinnamon buns on the side of her head. Miss Piggy of \"The Muppet Show\" copied the hairdo in a \"Star Wars\"-themed episode of the series in February 1980. In the 1987 Mel Brooks comedy film \"Spaceballs\", Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) appears to have the hairstyle, which is soon revealed to in fact be a large pair of headphones. In the parody film \"Thumb Wars\", the role of Leia was filled by a character named Princess Bunhead, who has two cinnamon rolls for hair. In 2015, Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd's character in the horror-comedy TV series \"Scream Queens\", a rich and disaffected sorority girl known as Chanel No. 3, wears earmuffs in every scene as an homage to Fisher's iconic Leia hairstyle.

Vigilantism iliibuka kwa sababu utekelezaji wa sheria za eneo na mahakama zilikuwa na nguvu kidogo katika kambi za madini za mbali wakati wa kipindi cha eneo.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Montana Vigilantes\nContent: The first written account of the vigilantes was Thomas Dimsdale's \"Vigilantes of Montana\" which first appeared as a series of articles in 1865 editions of the \"Montana Post\", Virginia City's and Montana's first newspaper. Dimsdale was a member of the Alder Gulch Vigilance Committee and editor of the \"Montana Post.\" His early accounts of the Alder Gulch vigilante events are widely cited and the book version of his articles, the first book published in Montana Territory in 1866, has been extensively reprinted since its first edition.\nX. Biedler, one of the Alder Gulch and Helena vigilante enforcers wrote about his vigilante activities in his personal journals. They weren't available until well after his death when Helen F. Sanders, the daughter-in-law of Wilbur Sanders finally got them published in 1957. Nathaniel Langford, also a member of the vigilantes, explorer of the upper Yellowstone (1870), first superintendent of Yellowstone National Park (1872–1877), territorial tax collector (1864–1869) and author published \"Vigilante Days and Ways-Pioneers of the Rockies\" in 1893 after he returned to his home in Minnesota. In a 1912 speech to the Montana Historical Society, western historian, Olin Wheeler provided positive commentary on the Alder Gulch vigilantes in a tribute to the life of Nathaniel Langford.\nAnother account, not published until 1982, is that of former Montana Supreme Court Justice (1922–1935) Lew L. Callaway. Edited by his son Lew Callaway Jr., \"Montana's Righteous Hangmen:The Vigilantes in Action\" stems from Callaway's association with vigilante Captain James William in the late 1800s. Lew Callaway wrote extensively about the vigilantes and his stories which add more intimate details about how the vigilantes operated are captured in this volume. Although some vigilante activities during this period were criticized by citizens and civic leaders, there was a general affirmation of their purpose and contribution to law and order in a growing territory. Mark C. Dillon's \"Montana Vigilantes 1863–1870 Gold, Guns and Gallows\" (2013) concludes that given the lawless environment and criminal activity in Alder Gulch and Helena at the time, the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time, the vigilantes acted in a way they thought was best for their communities. He contends that judging the vigilantes by today's understanding and standards of due process is problematic.\nIn 2004, Frederick Allen, a journalist and historian, published \"A Decent and Orderly Lynching:The Montana Vigilantes\" reviewed as an up-to-day balanced account of Montana's vigilante history (1864–1870). Allen's book reinforces the motivations and methods of the earliest vigilantes in Alder Gulch while commenting on the growing disdain for vigilantism in the late 1860s. More generalist works on Montana history such as Merrill G. Burlingame's \"The Montana Frontier\" (1942) and Michael P. Malone's \"Montana-A History of Two Centuries\" (1991) adequately summarize the vigilante period largely based on earlier accounts by Dimsdale, Langford and Biedler. Additionally, many topical histories of Montana, such as novelist and Montana historian Dan Cushman's \"Montana: The Gold Frontier\" (1973) cover the vigilante period.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was the Montana Vigilantes formed?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The Montana Vigilantes were formed in 1863, when the mining camps of what was then eastern Idaho Territory lacked effective legal authority ["}

Major security software vendors (including Microsoft itself) planned to continue offering support and definitions for Windows XP past the end of support to varying extents, along with the developers of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera web browsers; despite these measures, critics similarly argued that users should eventually migrate from XP to a supported platform. The United States' Computer Emergency Readiness Team released an alert in March 2014 advising users of the impending end of support, and informing them that using XP after April 8 may prevent them from meeting US government information security requirements.\nMicrosoft continued to provide Security Essentials virus definitions and updates for its Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) for XP until July 14, 2015. As the end of extended support approached, Microsoft began to increasingly urge XP customers to migrate to newer versions such as Windows 7 or 8 in the interest of security, suggesting that attackers could reverse engineer security patches for newer versions of Windows and use them to target equivalent vulnerabilities in XP.

Massless ropes, point particles, ideal gases and the particle in a box are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, Maxwell's equations and the Schrödinger equation. These laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by molecular orbital models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. In engineering, physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as finite element analysis.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is Mathematical physics used for?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Mathematical physics is used as a research approach for investigating and solving problems that originate in physics or in thought experiments by reformulating them within a mathematically rigorous framework, thereby blending techniques of pure mathematics with the conceptual aims of physics and providing a level of rigor beyond that typically found in theoretical physics ["}

Inspired by them, polymerization methods, utilizing DNA or RNA as templates to control sequences of polymer, are developed. At first, taking DNA or RNA as templates, scientists developed a series of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based polymers, without using DNA polymerases. But this method is limited to polymerization scale and yield. After that, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is developed, which currently is still the most extensively used sequence-regulated method. By employing enzymes, the yields and scales are greatly increased, but the specificity of enzymes towards natural peptides limits this technique to a certain degree. Nowadays, more attention is paid to utilization of ribosomes to directly mimic the transcription and translation process. This technology called protein engineering is considered as the most promising biological polymerization method for synthesis of sequence-controlled polymers.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is the most common natural polymer?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The most common natural polymer is cellulose, the plant-derived polymer that supplies the tensile strength for natural fibers and ropes and has been utilized for centuries in materials such as cloth and cordage ["}

Wasifu wake umefanywa kuwa ngumu sana kwa sababu ya retcons nyingi zinazohusika katika historia ya uchapishaji ya tabia yake na ile ya Jean Grey.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Madelyne Pryor\nContent: Madelyne's hairstyle design was modeled off the book's editor at the time, Louise Jones (later Louise Simonson)—a design retained on the character until 1988. Claremont named the character after Steeleye Span singer Maddy Prior. Claremont had already created a character named \"Maddy Pryor\", a little girl that appeared very briefly in \"Avengers Annual\" #10 (1981), and has no in-story connections to the X-Men character. Claremont, nonetheless, years later took an opportunity to indulge in an in-joke: in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #238 (1988), a similar child would appear as Madelyne's mental image of herself, wearing the same clothes as the little girl from \"Avengers Annual\" #10, repeating the girl's same line of dialogue, but also singing \"Gone to America\", one of Steeleye Span's biggest hits.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Does the character Madelyne \"Maddie\" Jennifer Pryor-Summers have super powers?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Based on the supplied information, the text describes Madelyne “Maddie” Jennifer Pryor‐Summers as a “fictional supervillainess,” notes her relationships, and recounts plot points such as her abandonment, the loss of her son, and the revelation that she is a clone of Jean Grey, but it provides no explicit details indicating that she possesses any superhuman powers or abilities; therefore, from the content given, it cannot be confirmed that she has super powers ["}

He described the full 2001 IPCC report as \"an admirable description of research activities in climate science\" although he criticized the Summary for Policymakers. Lindzen stated in May 2001 that it did not truly summarize the IPCC report but had been amended to state more definite conclusions. He also emphasized the fact that the summary had not been written by scientists alone.

The Soviet Union extended universal health care to its rural residents in 1969. Italy introduced its \"Servizio Sanitario Nazionale\" (National Health Service) in 1978. Universal health insurance was implemented in Australia beginning with the \"Medibank\" system which led to universal coverage under the Medicare system.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was universal health care introduced in France?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Universal health care in France traces back to 1945, when the state created the Sécurité Sociale system that laid the foundation for nationwide, publicly planned and operated health coverage for the population ["}

Every time is measured under one second, from the signal to draw to when the timer is stopped. The current World Fast Draw Association (WFDA) record for Open Class Fast Draw in an event called Standing Balloons is .208 seconds - and that includes the time it takes to react, draw, fire and pop a balloon target at eight feet away. A world class competitor can draw and fire a shot in under half a second. Given that the average human reaction time is around 0.2 to 0.25 seconds, the round is over before most people can react. The reaction times of the best fast draw shooters is 0.145 seconds, which means that the gun is cocked, drawn, aimed (from the hip), and fired in just over 0.06 seconds. To establish a World Fast Draw Association record, a second shot must be fired in the same competition that is no more than 0.30 seconds slower than the first; this is intended to prevent a shot that anticipates the start signal from setting a record. In competitions where two rounds must be fired, at separate targets, less than 0.10 seconds separate the shots.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How fast is the fastest firing machine gun?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The fastest-firing machine gun commonly fielded is the electrically driven M134 Minigun, whose six rotating barrels can sustain over 100 rounds per second, equivalent to about 6,000 rounds per minute (RPM) in cyclic rate of fire ["}

The method requires a controlled seismic source of energy, such as dynamite or Tovex blast, a specialized air gun or a seismic vibrator, commonly known by the trademark name Vibroseis. Reflection seismology is similar to sonar and echolocation. This article is about surface seismic surveys; for vertical seismic profiles, see VSP.\nReflections and refractions of seismic waves at geologic interfaces within the Earth were first observed on recordings of earthquake-generated seismic waves. The basic model of the Earth's deep interior is based on observations of earthquake-generated seismic waves transmitted through the Earth’s interior (e.g., Mohorovičić, 1910). The use of human-generated seismic waves to map in detail the geology of the upper few kilometers of the Earth's crust followed shortly thereafter and has developed mainly due to commercial enterprise, particularly the petroleum industry.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who first developed reflection seismology?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Fessenden is credited as the first developer of reflection seismology, having conceived the idea of using reflected seismic waves to infer subsurface geology, applied for the initial seismic exploration patent in 1914 (issued 1917), and carried out early research on acoustic‐wave propagation following the Titanic disaster of 1912 and during World War I submarine‐detection work ["}

One of the people believing Red John to be dead is James Panzer, a blogger pretending to devote his life to find a serial killer known as \"the San Joaquin Killer\" (abbreviated SJK, who has killed at least five young women). In reality, Panzer is the killer. Jane suspects Panzer but initially lacks the proof to expose him. When he and Panzer both appear on Karen Cross's television talk show discussing the SJK case, Jane recognizes Panzer has to be stopped and goads Panzer into comparing Red John unfavorably to SJK. Panzer rises to the bait, making bold statements that the SJK killings were the work of a genius and Red John by comparison is a \"\"common sociopath, lazy, sloppy, delusional\"\" and already forgotten since Jane killed him. Panzer then makes the same mistake made by Jane and Kristina Frye: belittling Red John in a public forum. A couple of hours after the television appearance, Panzer is found murdered, with Red John's smiley face painted in blood on one of the walls near his body. Panzer's murder proves Jane's theory that Red John is still alive. This makes Panzer Red John's ninth male victim.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Is John Part still alive?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Yes—John Part is still alive; the document states that he “is a Canadian professional darts player and commentator,” notes his birth date as 29 June 1966, and provides no indication of a date of death, all of which imply he remains living today ["}

Believing that the patina was evidence of corrosion, Congress authorized for various repairs, and to paint the statue both inside and out. There was considerable public protest against the proposed exterior painting. The Army Corps of Engineers studied the patina for any ill effects to the statue and concluded that it protected the skin, \"softened the outlines of the Statue and made it beautiful.\" The statue was painted only on the inside.

France was the second largest tank producer in the world, behind the Soviet Union (see French armoured fighting vehicle production during World War II). Their cavalry tank class filled the role of what are now called MBTs. They also fielded a heavy tank design, and several lighter types for scouting and infantry support. In addition to these types, they were also working on super-heavy breakthrough tanks (FCM F1). The French didn't have an independent Tank Corps. All tanks belonged to either the Infantry or the Cavalry.The Renault FT-17 had a long life and saw use in World War II and even later in Indochina. It was utilised as far away as in China, during the Chinese Civil wars, and versions of the tank were used both against and by the Japanese during the invasion of China. A large number found their way into both Republican and Nationalist hands during the Spanish Civil War. They were used in the Russian Revolution by both the Bolsheviks and the White Russians, and later by the Finns against the Soviets. France exported the FT-17 right up to World War II. The design was also developed by the Italians as the Fiat 3000 and the USSR as the T-18.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is the current French tank?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The current main battle tank in service with the French Army is the Leclerc tank, a modern MBT designed and produced by the French manufacturer GIAT (renamed Nexter) and named in honor of General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, the commander of the Free French 2nd Armoured Division that advanced on Paris in World War II ["}

The \"robot\" ended up being slow and expensive to run, using money that might be better spent on other library concerns, particularly acquisition and digital development. Extra floor space was opened up when redesigning so that about 9,000 square metres became accessible to the public, who make more than 700,000 visits a year.

Wakati tarehe ya mwisho ya switchover ya Merika ya 17 Februari ilisukuma baadaye hadi 12 Juni 2009 na kutumika tu kwa vituo vyenye leseni ya Amerika kwa hali yoyote, mipango ilitangazwa kwa hiari kufanya programu ya lugha ya lugha ya Kiingereza tu. Ishara ya analog ingerejeshwa kurudisha tena mtandao wa Galavisión wa Mexico (sio kuchanganyikiwa na kituo cha cable cha Amerika cha jina moja). Madai kwenye wavuti ya XETV kwamba kituo hicho kingekuwa kweli kusambaza ishara ya kipekee iliondolewa mnamo tarehe 17 Februari 2009 wakati kituo kiliamua kuchelewesha kukata ishara yake ya analog hadi baada ya kupata idhini kutoka kwa serikali ya Mexico. Usimamizi wa XETV baadaye ulisema kwamba imeamua kudumisha ishara yake ya analog ili kufaidi watazamaji wa Mexico. Ishara ya analog ya XETV hatimaye ilirudishwa mnamo tarehe 5 Machi 2012, wakati kituo kilianza kueneza ishara yake ya dijiti na kuongezwa kwa mtandao wa Canal 5 wa Televisa ulioelekezwa kwenye subchannel 6.2 na kwenye malisho yake ya analog, wakati Digital Channel 6.1 ilibakiza habari, mtandao wa CW na mipango iliyojumuishwa kwa Kiingereza. Katika tarehe hiyo hiyo, XHBJ-TV Channel 45 ilishuka Canal 5 kwa Galavisión. Mfereji wa 5 ulibadilisha programu ya lugha ya Kiingereza ya XETV kwenye ishara yake ya analog, ili kuwahudumia watazamaji wanaozungumza Kihispania huko Tijuana ambao hawakuwa na seti za runinga na viboreshaji vya dijiti au sanduku za kibadilishaji za dijiti kabla ya mabadiliko ya Soko la Tijuana 2013 kuwa televisheni ya dijiti. Kubadilisha ushirika sanjari na kuanza kwa utangazaji wa dijiti kwenye vituo vya Televisa Tijuana. Mfereji 5 ulihamia kwenye kituo chake cha msingi mnamo Mei 31, 2017, wakati huo, subchannel 6.2 iliondolewa.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: XETV-TDT\nContent: Because XETV-TDT is licensed to Tijuana by the Mexican government, it is not covered under the FCC's must carry rules. This means that local cable providers are not required to carry XETV-TDT, even if the television station requests to be carried under this provision. As an English-language station XETV had been carried by Cox Communications, Time Warner Cable (now Charter Spectrum) and AT&T U-verse in San Diego, all on channel 6. KFMB-TV's \"The CW San Diego\" has replaced XETV on the American cable systems, as well as satellite television providers DirecTV and Dish Network.

After the elder Snart insults him and his mother, calling them weak, Cold punches him, but finds himself unable to kill him, instead getting Heat Wave to do it. The Rogues have their confrontation with Inertia, despite interference by Zoom and Libra, and kill Inertia. Libra then reveals that he needs the Rogues because Barry Allen has returned from the dead, and the Flashes are potential threats to him and Darkseid. Though shocked by the news that Allen is alive, Cold still rejects his offer of membership. After regrouping, Cold and the other Rogues agree not to retire, claiming that the game is back on.

At his wits' end in the dark, Bilbo agreed to a riddle game with Gollum on the chance of being shown the way out of the mountains. In the first edition of \"The Hobbit\", Gollum's size is not stated. Only in the revised version is it specified that he is small and is actually an unnaturally long-lived Hobbit. Originally he was also characterized as being less bound to the Ring than in later versions; he offered to give the Ring to Bilbo if he lost the riddle game, and he showed Bilbo the way out of the mountains after losing. To fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien revised later editions of \"The Hobbit\": The version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the Dwarves and Gandalf. In the new version Gollum pretended that he would show Bilbo the way out if he lost the riddle-game, but he actually planned to use the Ring to kill and eat the hobbit. Discovering the Ring missing, he suddenly realized the answer to Bilbo's last riddle – \"What have I got in my pocket?\" – and flew into a rage. Bilbo inadvertently discovered the Ring's power of invisibility as he fled, allowing him to follow Gollum undetected to a back entrance of the caves. Gollum was convinced that Bilbo knew the way out all along, and hoped to intercept him near the entrance, lest the goblins apprehend Bilbo and find the Ring. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum in order to escape, but was overcome with pity, and so merely leaped over him. As Bilbo escaped, Gollum cried out, \"Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins!

In contrast, project management is about doing projects right. And also according to this view, successful projects deliver on time, to budget and to specification, whereas successful programs deliver long term improvements to an organization. Improvements are usually identified through benefits.

Its appearance is considered appealing, with white spots, black barring and vivid crimson marks at the ear and upper tail. Red-eared firetails are usually only glimpsed briefly, if at all, as they move rapidly and discreetly through their habitat. Most observations occur when their soft voice is heard, or in flight when flushed from the dense scrub. Males and females are similar in colouring and bond as lifelong pairs that occupy a territory centred on their roosting and brooding nest site. The species occupy a similar ecological niche to the beautiful firetail \"Stagonopleura bella\" found in the east of Australia, although unlike other species of the genus they only occasionally group together and are almost never seen in large flocks.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What do red-eared firetails primarily eat?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The red-eared firetail’s diet is mainly composed of seeds, reflecting its classification as a “seed-eating estrildid” grass finch ["}

Simon's greatest triumph was the victory against superior numbers at the Battle of Muret—a battle which saw not only the defeat of Raymond of Toulouse and his Occitan allies—but also the death of Peter of Aragon—and the effective end of the ambitions of the house of Aragon/Barcelona in the Languedoc. This was in the medium and longer term of much greater significance to the royal house of France than it was to de Montfort—and with the battle of Bouvines was to secure the position of Philip Augustus vis a vis England and the Empire.
