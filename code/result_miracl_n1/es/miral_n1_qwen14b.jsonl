Referred to as \"the bible of the amateur botanist,\" its success was such that it went into more than 50 editions and was still in print a century after it first came out.

The partition took place on 16 October 1905 and separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas. The former province of Bengal was divided into two new provinces \"Bengal\" (comprising western Bengal as well as the province of Bihar and Orissa) and Eastern Bengal and Assam with Dacca as the capital of the latter. Partition was promoted for administrative reasons: Bengal was geographically as large as France and had a significantly larger population. Curzon stated the eastern region was neglected and under-governed. By splitting the province, an improved administration could be established in the east, where subsequently, the population would benefit from new schools and employment opportunities. The Hindus of West Bengal who dominated Bengal's business and rural life complained that the division would make them a minority in a province that would incorporate the province of Bihar and Orissa. Indians were outraged at what they recognised as a \"divide and rule\" policy.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How large is Bengal by area?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Bengal spans a total area of about 232,752 square kilometres, a territory that collectively includes the Indian state of West Bengal and the independent nation of Bangladesh ["}

One stained-glass window, \"The Flight into Egypt\", was spared destruction due to being in Connecticut for repair. The third Notre Dame was designed and built around this window. The three Angels that had adorned the Sanctuary Lamp and two candlesticks, though in the middle of the blaze, managed to survive the inferno. These too are part of the new church. The Sacred Heart Monument also miraculously survived the blaze even though it was in close proximity to the church. It wasn't until 1986 that the new church was built and ready for use. The orientation of the new building is reverse what the old one was. The new churches \"front\" sits in the footprint of the old churches \"rear\". In 2012, it was revealed that the parish of Notre Dame de Lourdes would be merging with the parish of Immaculate Conception in Fall River.

The place contains World War I drill halls built for militia units of infantry, and more specialised groups such as the artillery, engineers and service corps, and as such demonstrates the extent of the various sections of the armed forces at the time and the commitment of the citizen soldiers who composed these units.

Hamilton\nContent: Hamilton led a two-man field party in Antarctica (October 1958–January 1959) for the International Geophysical Year, and launched a new understanding of Antarctica. He was the first to apply the name trans-Antarctic Mountains (two years later, formalized as Transantarctic Mountains) to that 3,500 km range. Hamilton recognized that a large sector of this range contained distinctive granitic rocks like South Australia's Adelaide orogenic belt. Associated fossils of diverse ages in Antarctica, Australia, and southernmost Africa further linked these continents, and supported then-radical explanations of continental drift. Before traveling to Antarctica, Hamilton was what he later described as a \"closet drifter,\" aware that Southern Hemisphere geology provided powerful evidence favoring continental drift.

However, Houghton Mifflin's school edition did not sell as well. As Geisel noted in Jonathan Cott's 1983 profile of him, \"Houghton Mifflin... had trouble selling it to the schools; there were a lot of Dick and Jane devotees, and my book was considered too fresh and irreverent.

He was a frail child, nearly dying of pneumonia in his early years and missing a whole year of school as a result. In his early years Chamberlain was not interested in basketball, because he thought it was \"a game for sissies\". Instead, he was an avid track and field athlete: as a youth, he high jumped 6 feet, 6 inches, ran the 440 yards in 49.0 seconds and the 880 yards in 1:58.3, put the shot 53 feet, 4 inches, and broad jumped 22 feet. But according to Chamberlain, \"basketball was king in Philadelphia\", so he eventually turned to the sport. Because Chamberlain was a very tall child, already measuring at age 10 and when he entered Philadelphia's Overbrook High School, he had a natural advantage against his peers; he soon was renowned for his scoring talent, his physical strength and his shot blocking abilities. According to ESPN journalist Hal Bock, Chamberlain was \"scary, flat-out frightening... before he came along, most basketball players were mortal-sized men. Chamberlain changed that.\" It was also in this period of his life when his three lifelong nicknames \"Wilt the Stilt\", \"Goliath\", and his favorite, \"The Big Dipper\", were allegedly born.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When did Wilton Norman Chamberlain die?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Wilton Norman Chamberlain died on October 12, 1999 ["}

Panagoulis ignited a bomb at a point of the coastal road where the limousine carrying Papadopoulos would have to slow down, but the bomb failed to harm Papadopoulos.

En 1964, Bernice Neugarten afirmó que la satisfacción en la vejez dependía del mantenimiento activo de relaciones y esfuerzos personales.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Activity theory\nContent: AT remained virtually unknown outside the Soviet Union until the mid-1980s, when it was picked up by Scandinavian researchers. The first international conference on activity theory was not held until 1986. The earliest non-Soviet paper cited by Nardi is a 1987 paper by Yrjö Engeström: \"Learning by expanding\". This resulted in a reformulation of AT. Kuutti notes that the term \"activity theory\" \"can be used in two senses: referring to the original Soviet tradition or referring to the international, multi-voiced community applying the original ideas and developing them further.\"\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was activity theory created?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Havighurst in 1961, making that year its point of creation and formal introduction into gerontological discourse ["}

El Triple XS volvió al logotipo de la compañía y se usaron en casi todos los anuncios de Pearl. El XS desempeñó este importante papel hasta el final de la producción en la cervecería en 2001, cuando la cervecería cerró sus puertas y el logotipo de la compañía fue abandonado. A medida que la producción de Light Pearl y Pearl giró en las instalaciones de Miller's Fort Worth, los logotipos del producto fueron rediseñados. La etiqueta actualizada no utiliza el triple XS, por lo que una parte importante de la identidad de la empresa se ha eliminado prácticamente de las cervezas de perlas. Sin embargo, Pearl's Country Club Malt Liquor todavía muestra los XXXs en su logotipo.\nMuchas personas se preguntan de dónde vinieron el XS y cómo se usaron en la cerveza. En verdad, las tres X son en realidad un sistema de calificación de calidad. El sistema se usó inicialmente en Europa durante el siglo XVI. A medida que la realeza europea viajaba sus tierras y visitaba los condados vecinos, se envió un mensajero real por delante de la fiesta oficial. El trabajo de The Courier consistía en probar cerveza en las posadas en el camino. Si la cerveza fuera solo promedio, el mensajero marcaría el letrero o la puerta de la posada con una sola X. Si la cerveza de la posada se considerara buena, el letrero o la puerta recibirían dos X. Una marca en una posada de tres X significaba que la cerveza en el interior era excelente, y una parada obligada para la corte real al pasar.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Pearl Brewing Company\nContent: The triple Xs were adopted by the San Antonio Brewing Association to portray two things: the high quality of their beers, and the pride that workers put into their products. The triple Xs may be gone from company and Pearl beer logos, but it has not completely vanished. In the 1960s, Pearl absorbed the Goetz Brewing Company and made Country Club Malt Liquor one of Pearl's key products. When Country Club received its only product makeover a few years after the buyout, it gained the triple Xs in its logo. The Xs were situated in the top-center of the logo's crown. Country Club is still produced today, and it still carries the “xXx” mark of Pearl.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Is Pearl beer still in production?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Yes—while Pearl’s historic San Antonio brewery shut down in 2001, production of Pearl and Pearl Light was transferred to Miller’s facility in Fort Worth, so the brand continues to be brewed even though the original plant and its traditional triple-X logo were retired ["}

These interventions cause degeneration of the nerve's fibers and temporary (a few months, usually) interference with the transmission of nerve signals. In these procedures, the thin protective layer around the nerve fiber, the basal lamina, is preserved so that, as a damaged fiber regrows, it travels within its basal lamina tube and connects with the correct loose end, and function may be restored. Surgical cutting of a nerve (neurectomy), severs these basal lamina tubes, and without them to channel the regrowing fibers to their lost connections, over time a painful neuroma or deafferentation pain may develop. This is why the neurolytic is usually preferred over the surgical block.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Can you cut a nerve fiber?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Adjunctive strategies like localized delivery of soluble neurotrophic factors are under investigation to accelerate axonal regeneration within grafts ["}

Hay muchos axiomas en la producción de dentaduras postizas que deben entenderse; La ignorancia de un axioma puede conducir a la falla de la dentadura postiza. En la gran mayoría de los casos, las dentaduras postizas completas deben estar cómodas poco después de la inserción, aunque casi siempre se necesitan al menos dos visitas de ajuste para eliminar la causa de las manchas doloridas. Uno de los aspectos más críticos de las dentaduras postizas es que la impresión de la dentadura postiza debe hacerse y utilizar perfectamente con una técnica perfecta para hacer un modelo preciso de las encías edéntulas (sin dientes) del paciente. El dentista o el denturista deben usar un proceso llamado moldeo de borde para garantizar que las bridas de la dentadura postiza se extiendan adecuadamente. Puede ocurrir una variedad de problemas si la impresión final de la dentadura postiza no se realiza correctamente. Un dentista requiere una paciencia considerable para que un dentista sepa cómo hacer una dentadura postiza, y por esta razón puede ser lo mejor para el paciente buscar un especialista, ya sea un próstodoncista o denturista, para hacer la dentadura postiza. Un denturista es un profesional capacitado y con licencia que ve a los pacientes que necesitan dentaduras postizas, parciales, fijaciones o reparaciones. Un denturista no solo toma la impresión, sino que hace que toda la dentadura postiza en su propio laboratorio. El denturista luego programa una fecha para la entrega de las dentaduras postizas terminadas al paciente. Un dentista general puede hacer un buen trabajo haciendo dentaduras postizas, pero solo si es meticuloso y con experiencia. Muchos dentistas ya no hacen dentaduras postizas. Pero, en cambio, tenga una impresión de la boca de los pacientes y luego envíe las impresiones a un laboratorio dental, que podría estar en cualquier parte del mundo, o enviar al paciente a un denturista. Una vez que el laboratorio recibe impresiones dentales de la boca del paciente, el laboratorio le crea moldes de yeso. El laboratorio utiliza los moldes para crear las llantas de cera utilizadas para registrar la mordedura del paciente. Estas llantas de cera son devueltas al dentista, que los usa para registrar la mordida del paciente. El dentista puede ayudar al paciente a elegir el tamaño correcto de los dientes para las dentaduras postizas, o simplemente hacer la selección él mismo. Una vez que se completa el registro de la mordida y los dientes se seleccionan para las dentaduras postizas, el borde de la cera generalmente se devuelve al laboratorio dental para que los dientes de la dentadura postiza se coloquen en la cera. Una vez que los dientes se colocan en el borde de la cera, el resultado es una dentadura postiza prefincada que se parece casi al producto terminado. Esta dentadura postiza prefincuada generalmente se devuelve al consultorio del dentista y el paciente generalmente tiene la oportunidad de aprobar la configuración (para dentaduras postizas inmediatas o estándar) o probar la dentadura postiza antes de que se termine. Después de la aprobación del paciente, el dentista devuelve la dentadura previa al laboratorio para el procesamiento final. La dentadura dentada terminada se devuelve al consultorio del dentista para su entrega al paciente.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Denture cleaner\nContent: A denture cleaner (also termed denture cleanser), is a cleaner used to clean dentures when they are out of the mouth. Their main use is to control the growth of microorganisms on the dentures, especially \"Candida albicans\", thereby preventing denture-related stomatitis. When dentures are worn in the mouth, a biofilm develops which may be similar to dental plaque. It may become hardened and mineralized as dental calculus. Denture cleansers are also used to remove stains and other debris that may be caused by diet, tobacco use, drinking coffee, drinking tea, etc.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is a denture specialist called?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: A specialist who focuses on the design, fabrication, and fitting of complete or partial dentures is commonly called a prosthodontist or, in jurisdictions where they are licensed, a denturist; both professionals possess advanced training specifically aimed at producing comfortable, functional dentures and managing related oral-rehabilitation issues ["}

They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of the cubs varies – sometimes a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.\nWeaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest. When one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. Females often fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the male. Cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. Up to 80% of lion cubs will die before the age of two.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Why do lions kill their own cubs?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Male–lion infanticide occurs chiefly when a new dominant male or coalition takes over a pride; by killing nursing cubs that are not his, he removes future rivals and, crucially, causes the mothers to stop lactating and return to estrus sooner, giving him an earlier chance to mate and pass on his own genes, so the behavior is favored by natural selection and persists in the population ["}

Se utilizan para tratar afecciones crónicas complejas o raras como cáncer, artritis reumatoide, hemofilia, H.I.V. La psoriasis, la enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal y la hepatitis C. En 1990 había 10 medicamentos especializados en el mercado, a mediados de la década de 1990 había menos de 30, en 2008 había 200, y para 2015 había 300. Los medicamentos a menudo se definen como especialidades porque su precio es mucho más alto que el de los medicamentos sin pisos. Medicare define cualquier medicamento para el cual el precio negociado es de $ 670 por mes o más, como un medicamento especializado que se coloca en un nivel especializado que requiere un mayor costo compartido de pacientes. Los medicamentos también se identifican como especialidad cuando hay un requisito de manejo especial o el medicamento solo está disponible a través de una red de distribuciones limitadas. Para 2015, \"los medicamentos especializados representaron un tercio de todos los gastos en drogas en los Estados Unidos, en comparación con el 19 por ciento en 2004 y se dirigieron hacia el 50 por ciento en los próximos 10 años\", según IMS Health, que rastrea las prescripciones.

The first European explorer to sight New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel Tasman on 13 December 1642. The Dutch were also the first non-natives to explore and chart New Zealand's coastline. Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various Māori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving Māori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from Māori to Pākehā (European) ownership, and most Māori subsequently became impoverished.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was New Zealand first settled?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Archaeological and traditional evidence indicate that the first human settlement of New Zealand occurred when Polynesian ancestors of the Māori arrived between AD 1280 and 1320, marking the beginning of continuous habitation in the islands ["}

The publication of the work coincided with Swift's striking out on his own, having despaired of getting a good \"living\" from Temple or Temple's influence. There is speculation about what caused the rift between Swift and his employer, but, as A. C. Elias persuasively argues, it seems that the final straw came with Swift's work on Temple's \"Letters.\" Swift had been engaged to translate Temple's French correspondence, but Temple, or someone close to Temple, edited the French text to make Temple seem both prescient and more fluent. Consequently, the letters and the translations Swift provided did not gibe, and, since Swift could not accuse Temple of falsifying his letters, and because the public would never believe that the retired state minister had lied, Swift came across as incompetent.\nEven though Swift published the \"Tale\" as he left Temple's service, it was conceived earlier, and the book is a salvo in one of Temple's battles. Swift's general polemic concerns an argument (the \"Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns\") that had been over for nearly ten years by the time the book was published. The \"Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns\" was a French academic debate of the early 1690s, occasioned by Fontenelle arguing that modern scholarship had allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge. Temple argued against this position in his \"On Ancient and Modern Learning\" (where he provided the first English formulation of the commonplace that modern critics see more only because they are dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants), and Temple's somewhat naive essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were Richard Bentley (classicist and editor) and William Wotton (critic).\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Where was Jonathan Swift born?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, on 30 November 1667 ["}

In this sense there are many human 'races.' But this is not the sense in which many anthropologists, race-classifiers, and racists have used the term.\" He admits that in a biological sense, there is the existence of races within mankind. However, he also believes that not all of mankind can be classified. Part of his reasoning has to do with mixed origin, which has resulted in “overlapping” of physicalities. Instead of races and subspecies, he prefers mixed ethnic groups. His writing further emphasizes the complexity of our descent and rejects claims that support one race being superior when compared to others.

Initially, he determined there should be a community of Benedictine monks at the new cathedral, performing the liturgies and singing the daily Office. This caused great resentment amongst the secular clergy of the diocese, who felt they were being snubbed. In the end, negotiations with both the English Benedictines and the community of French Benedictines at Farnborough failed and a 'traditional' choir of men and boys was set up instead. Despite great financial problems, the Choir School opened on 5 October 1901 with eleven boy choristers, in the building originally intended for the Benedictine monks.

Este descubrimiento se atribuye en gran medida a Robert Hooke, y comenzó el estudio científico de células, también conocido como biología celular. Más de un siglo después, muchos debates sobre células comenzaron entre los científicos. La mayoría de estos debates involucraron la naturaleza de la regeneración celular y la idea de las células como una unidad fundamental de vida. La teoría celular finalmente se formuló en 1839.

The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T-cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis.

In 2008, the World Series of Backgammon ran the world's largest international events in London, the UK Masters, the biggest tournament ever held in the UK with 128 international class players; the Nordic Open, which instantly became the largest in the world with around 500 players in all flights and 153 in the Championship, and Cannes, which hosted the Riviera Cup, the traditional follow-up tournament to the World Championships. Cannes also hosted the WSOB Championship, the WSOB finale, which saw 16 players play three-point shootout matches for €160,000. The event was recorded for television in Europe airing on Eurosport.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is the largest international backgammon organization?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The largest international backgammon organization is the World Backgammon Association (WBA), which has run the circuit’s biggest series, the European Backgammon Tour, since 2007 and extends its reach through events such as the US Open and the high-stakes Crowns Cup broadcast on multiple television channels, demonstrating both global scope and influence ["}

The Basin and Range province is a region of east-west crustal extension. This province adds tension perpendicular to the fault line causing the fault blocks to move apart. The Idaho-Wyoming Thrust belt is located south of the Teton fault and is a region of thick and deformed crust that prevents the fault from extending farther south. The Rocky Mountain Foreland is located east of the Teton fault and is a region of thicker crust. This section of crust is heavier and adds to the vertical downward force on the hanging wall of fault.

In 1929 Temianka owned the violin made in 1752 by Joannes Baptista Guadagnini. In the 1930s he played a Silvestre violin, with which he made his early Vintage recordings, and subsequently a Januarius Gagliano and a Carlo Bergonzi.\nThe Stradivarius he played during the years of the Paganini Quartet was the \"Comte Cozio di Salabue\" of 1727, which was Paganini's own concert violin. It was later played by Martin Beaver, first violinist of the Tokyo String Quartet, which played since 1995 on the same quartet of Stradivarius instruments once owned by Paganini, until the Tokyo String Quartet retired in July 2013. These remarkable instruments—the viola had inspired Paganini to commission Hector Berlioz's \"Harold en Italie\"—were also played by the Cleveland Quartet for almost 15 years, beginning in 1982, and are presently owned by Nippon Music Foundation of Japan, after deacquisition by the Corcoran Gallery in the mid-1990s for $15 million. They were then played for several years by the Hagen Quartet, and are now in the hands of the Quartetto di Cremona.\nWhen the years of the Paganini Quartet came to an end, Temianka played a Michelangelo Bergonzi of 1759. His recordings of the Handel Sonatas were made on an Andrea Guarneri of 1687.In February 2013, Chapman University endowed the Henri Temianka Professorship in Music and Scholarship in String Studies.

In addition to many arbitrary taxes, Richard I established the Ordinance of the Jewry in 1194 in an attempt to organize the Jewish community. It ensured that mandatory records would be kept by royal officials for all Jewish transactions. Every debt was recorded on a chirography to allow the king immediate and complete access to Jewish property. Richard also established a special exchequer to collect any unpaid debts due after the death of a Jewish creditor. The establishment of the Exchequer of the Jews eventually made all transactions of the English Jewry liable to taxation by the king in addition to the 10% of all sums recovered by Jews with the help of English courts. So, while the First and Second Crusades increased anti-Jewish sentiments, Jews in England went relatively unscathed beyond occasional fines and special levies.

Proposed following the often bitter 1787–88 debate over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and written to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215).

A February 1978 cover story for the British teen magazine \"Jackie\" included step-by-step instructions on how to replicate Leia's hair buns. In the 1978 short film parody \"Hardware Wars\", Princess Anne-Droid has actual cinnamon buns on the side of her head. Miss Piggy of \"The Muppet Show\" copied the hairdo in a \"Star Wars\"-themed episode of the series in February 1980. In the 1987 Mel Brooks comedy film \"Spaceballs\", Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) appears to have the hairstyle, which is soon revealed to in fact be a large pair of headphones. In the parody film \"Thumb Wars\", the role of Leia was filled by a character named Princess Bunhead, who has two cinnamon rolls for hair. In 2015, Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd's character in the horror-comedy TV series \"Scream Queens\", a rich and disaffected sorority girl known as Chanel No. 3, wears earmuffs in every scene as an homage to Fisher's iconic Leia hairstyle.

Las actividades vigilantes continuaron, aunque algo esporádicamente, a través del período territorial de Montana hasta que el territorio se convirtió en el estado de Montana el 8 de noviembre de 1889. Surgió el vigilantismo porque la policía territorial y los tribunales tenían muy poco poder en los campos mineros remotos durante el período territorial.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Montana Vigilantes\nContent: The first written account of the vigilantes was Thomas Dimsdale's \"Vigilantes of Montana\" which first appeared as a series of articles in 1865 editions of the \"Montana Post\", Virginia City's and Montana's first newspaper. Dimsdale was a member of the Alder Gulch Vigilance Committee and editor of the \"Montana Post.\" His early accounts of the Alder Gulch vigilante events are widely cited and the book version of his articles, the first book published in Montana Territory in 1866, has been extensively reprinted since its first edition.\nX. Biedler, one of the Alder Gulch and Helena vigilante enforcers wrote about his vigilante activities in his personal journals. They weren't available until well after his death when Helen F. Sanders, the daughter-in-law of Wilbur Sanders finally got them published in 1957. Nathaniel Langford, also a member of the vigilantes, explorer of the upper Yellowstone (1870), first superintendent of Yellowstone National Park (1872–1877), territorial tax collector (1864–1869) and author published \"Vigilante Days and Ways-Pioneers of the Rockies\" in 1893 after he returned to his home in Minnesota. In a 1912 speech to the Montana Historical Society, western historian, Olin Wheeler provided positive commentary on the Alder Gulch vigilantes in a tribute to the life of Nathaniel Langford.\nAnother account, not published until 1982, is that of former Montana Supreme Court Justice (1922–1935) Lew L. Callaway. Edited by his son Lew Callaway Jr., \"Montana's Righteous Hangmen:The Vigilantes in Action\" stems from Callaway's association with vigilante Captain James William in the late 1800s. Lew Callaway wrote extensively about the vigilantes and his stories which add more intimate details about how the vigilantes operated are captured in this volume. Although some vigilante activities during this period were criticized by citizens and civic leaders, there was a general affirmation of their purpose and contribution to law and order in a growing territory. Mark C. Dillon's \"Montana Vigilantes 1863–1870 Gold, Guns and Gallows\" (2013) concludes that given the lawless environment and criminal activity in Alder Gulch and Helena at the time, the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time, the vigilantes acted in a way they thought was best for their communities. He contends that judging the vigilantes by today's understanding and standards of due process is problematic.\nIn 2004, Frederick Allen, a journalist and historian, published \"A Decent and Orderly Lynching:The Montana Vigilantes\" reviewed as an up-to-day balanced account of Montana's vigilante history (1864–1870). Allen's book reinforces the motivations and methods of the earliest vigilantes in Alder Gulch while commenting on the growing disdain for vigilantism in the late 1860s. More generalist works on Montana history such as Merrill G. Burlingame's \"The Montana Frontier\" (1942) and Michael P. Malone's \"Montana-A History of Two Centuries\" (1991) adequately summarize the vigilante period largely based on earlier accounts by Dimsdale, Langford and Biedler. Additionally, many topical histories of Montana, such as novelist and Montana historian Dan Cushman's \"Montana: The Gold Frontier\" (1973) cover the vigilante period.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was the Montana Vigilantes formed?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The Montana Vigilantes were formed in 1863, when the mining camps of what was then eastern Idaho Territory lacked effective legal authority ["}

Major security software vendors (including Microsoft itself) planned to continue offering support and definitions for Windows XP past the end of support to varying extents, along with the developers of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera web browsers; despite these measures, critics similarly argued that users should eventually migrate from XP to a supported platform. The United States' Computer Emergency Readiness Team released an alert in March 2014 advising users of the impending end of support, and informing them that using XP after April 8 may prevent them from meeting US government information security requirements.\nMicrosoft continued to provide Security Essentials virus definitions and updates for its Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) for XP until July 14, 2015. As the end of extended support approached, Microsoft began to increasingly urge XP customers to migrate to newer versions such as Windows 7 or 8 in the interest of security, suggesting that attackers could reverse engineer security patches for newer versions of Windows and use them to target equivalent vulnerabilities in XP.

El campo magnético es generado por corrientes eléctricas debido al movimiento de las corrientes de convección de hierro fundido en el núcleo externo de la Tierra impulsado por el calor que se escapan del núcleo, un proceso natural llamado Geodynamo.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Force\nContent: where formula_48 is the magnitude of the hypothetical test current and formula_49 is the length of hypothetical wire through which the test current flows. The magnetic field exerts a force on all magnets including, for example, those used in compasses. The fact that the Earth's magnetic field is aligned closely with the orientation of the Earth's axis causes compass magnets to become oriented because of the magnetic force pulling on the needle.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is the magnetic force of the Earth?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The Earth’s magnetic “force,” more accurately described as the magnetic field strength, ranges from about 25 to 65 microteslas (0.25 to 0.65 gauss) at the planet’s surface, behaving roughly like that of a tilted bar-magnet dipole whose axis is offset by about 11° from Earth’s rotation axis ["}

The occurrence of carnivores in other sites, as in Boquete de Zafarraya, alternates with human presence in the stratigraphy. This event is interpreted as a seasonal occupation of the site by humans. When humans leave this habitat, carnivores take place of the site. Since this situation is not observed at Cave of the Angel, and moreover, there is no interruption in the stratigraphy of human presence, it is likely that a long term human occupation took place. In contrast, the existence of those few carnivore remains can be explained as the result of human consumption as so it happens with rabbit remains (\"Oryctolagus cuniculus\").\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Are humans considered carnivores?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Humans are not classified as carnivores; they are omnivores, meaning they regularly consume and are physiologically capable of digesting both animal and plant foods, a trait shared with other Hominidae such as chimpanzees ["}

Inspired by them, polymerization methods, utilizing DNA or RNA as templates to control sequences of polymer, are developed. At first, taking DNA or RNA as templates, scientists developed a series of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based polymers, without using DNA polymerases. But this method is limited to polymerization scale and yield. After that, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is developed, which currently is still the most extensively used sequence-regulated method. By employing enzymes, the yields and scales are greatly increased, but the specificity of enzymes towards natural peptides limits this technique to a certain degree. Nowadays, more attention is paid to utilization of ribosomes to directly mimic the transcription and translation process. This technology called protein engineering is considered as the most promising biological polymerization method for synthesis of sequence-controlled polymers.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is the most common natural polymer?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The most common natural polymer is cellulose, the plant-derived polymer that supplies the tensile strength for natural fibers and ropes and has been utilized for centuries in materials such as cloth and cordage ["}

The universities offer a wide variety of courses on different levels.\nMultiple colleges and universities have historically had connections to the YMCA. Springfield College, of Springfield, Massachusetts, was founded in 1885 as an international training school for YMCA Professionals, while one of the two schools that eventually became Concordia University—Sir George Williams College—started from night courses offered at the Montreal YMCA. Northeastern University began out of a YMCA in Boston, and Franklin University began as the YMCA School of Commerce. San Francisco's Golden Gate University traces its roots to the founding of the YMCA Night School on 1 November 1881. Detroit College of Law, now the Michigan State University College of Law, was founded with a strong connection to the Detroit, Michigan YMCA. It had a 99-year lease on the site, and it was only when it expired that the college moved to East Lansing, Michigan. Youngstown State University traces its roots to the establishment of a law school by the local YMCA in 1908. The Nashville School of Law was the YMCA Night Law School until November 1986, having offered law classes since 1911 and the degree of Juris Doctor since January 1927. YMCA pioneered the concept of night school, providing educational opportunities for people with full-time employment. Many YMCAs offer ESL programmes, alternative high school, day care, and summer camp programs. In India, YMCA University of Science and Technology Faridabad was founded in 1969.

Despite this mishap, the remainder of Victor Emmanuel II's reign was consumed by wrapping up loose ends and dealing with economic and cultural issues. His role in day-to-day governing gradually dwindled, as it became increasingly apparent that a king could no longer keep a government in office against the will of Parliament.

Every time is measured under one second, from the signal to draw to when the timer is stopped. The current World Fast Draw Association (WFDA) record for Open Class Fast Draw in an event called Standing Balloons is .208 seconds - and that includes the time it takes to react, draw, fire and pop a balloon target at eight feet away. A world class competitor can draw and fire a shot in under half a second. Given that the average human reaction time is around 0.2 to 0.25 seconds, the round is over before most people can react. The reaction times of the best fast draw shooters is 0.145 seconds, which means that the gun is cocked, drawn, aimed (from the hip), and fired in just over 0.06 seconds. To establish a World Fast Draw Association record, a second shot must be fired in the same competition that is no more than 0.30 seconds slower than the first; this is intended to prevent a shot that anticipates the start signal from setting a record. In competitions where two rounds must be fired, at separate targets, less than 0.10 seconds separate the shots.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How fast is the fastest firing machine gun?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The fastest-firing machine gun commonly fielded is the electrically driven M134 Minigun, whose six rotating barrels can sustain over 100 rounds per second, equivalent to about 6,000 rounds per minute (RPM) in cyclic rate of fire ["}

Inicialmente, su trabajo fue sobre la propagación de las ondas acústicas en el agua, motivado por el hundimiento del Titanic por un iceberg en 1912. También trabajó en métodos para detectar submarinos durante la Primera Guerra Mundial. Él solicitó la primera patente sobre un método de exploración sísmica en 1914, que se emitió en 1917. Debido a la guerra, no fue posible para seguir la idea. John Clarence Karcher descubrió reflexiones sísmicas de forma independiente mientras trabajaba para la Oficina de Estándares de los Estados Unidos (ahora el Instituto Nacional de Normas y Tecnología) sobre métodos de sonido que se extiende para detectar artillería. En una discusión con colegas, la idea desarrolló que estas reflexiones podrían ayudar en la exploración del petróleo. Con varios otros, muchos afiliados a la Universidad de Oklahoma, Karcher ayudó a formar la compañía de ingeniería geológica, incorporada en Oklahoma en abril de 1920. Las primeras pruebas de campo se realizaron cerca de Oklahoma City, Oklahoma en 1921.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Reflection seismology\nContent: Reflection seismology (or seismic reflection) is a method of exploration geophysics that uses the principles of seismology to estimate the properties of the Earth's subsurface from reflected seismic waves. The method requires a controlled seismic source of energy, such as dynamite or Tovex blast, a specialized air gun or a seismic vibrator, commonly known by the trademark name Vibroseis. Reflection seismology is similar to sonar and echolocation. This article is about surface seismic surveys; for vertical seismic profiles, see VSP.\nReflections and refractions of seismic waves at geologic interfaces within the Earth were first observed on recordings of earthquake-generated seismic waves. The basic model of the Earth's deep interior is based on observations of earthquake-generated seismic waves transmitted through the Earth’s interior (e.g., Mohorovičić, 1910). The use of human-generated seismic waves to map in detail the geology of the upper few kilometers of the Earth's crust followed shortly thereafter and has developed mainly due to commercial enterprise, particularly the petroleum industry.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who first developed reflection seismology?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Fessenden is credited as the first developer of reflection seismology, having conceived the idea of using reflected seismic waves to infer subsurface geology, applied for the initial seismic exploration patent in 1914 (issued 1917), and carried out early research on acoustic‐wave propagation following the Titanic disaster of 1912 and during World War I submarine‐detection work ["}

Although it was originally known simply as the Rugby Road Bridge, when the Beta Theta Pi fraternity built their house at the corner of Chancellor and Rugby in 1927, it took its current name. In 1971, that fraternity location was closed, and the Delta Upsilon fraternity moved into its current location at 180 Rugby Road.

One of the people believing Red John to be dead is James Panzer, a blogger pretending to devote his life to find a serial killer known as \"the San Joaquin Killer\" (abbreviated SJK, who has killed at least five young women). In reality, Panzer is the killer. Jane suspects Panzer but initially lacks the proof to expose him. When he and Panzer both appear on Karen Cross's television talk show discussing the SJK case, Jane recognizes Panzer has to be stopped and goads Panzer into comparing Red John unfavorably to SJK. Panzer rises to the bait, making bold statements that the SJK killings were the work of a genius and Red John by comparison is a \"\"common sociopath, lazy, sloppy, delusional\"\" and already forgotten since Jane killed him. Panzer then makes the same mistake made by Jane and Kristina Frye: belittling Red John in a public forum. A couple of hours after the television appearance, Panzer is found murdered, with Red John's smiley face painted in blood on one of the walls near his body. Panzer's murder proves Jane's theory that Red John is still alive.

France was the second largest tank producer in the world, behind the Soviet Union (see French armoured fighting vehicle production during World War II). Their cavalry tank class filled the role of what are now called MBTs. They also fielded a heavy tank design, and several lighter types for scouting and infantry support. In addition to these types, they were also working on super-heavy breakthrough tanks (FCM F1). The French didn't have an independent Tank Corps. All tanks belonged to either the Infantry or the Cavalry.The Renault FT-17 had a long life and saw use in World War II and even later in Indochina. It was utilised as far away as in China, during the Chinese Civil wars, and versions of the tank were used both against and by the Japanese during the invasion of China. A large number found their way into both Republican and Nationalist hands during the Spanish Civil War. They were used in the Russian Revolution by both the Bolsheviks and the White Russians, and later by the Finns against the Soviets. France exported the FT-17 right up to World War II. The design was also developed by the Italians as the Fiat 3000 and the USSR as the T-18.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is the current French tank?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The current main battle tank in service with the French Army is the Leclerc tank, a modern MBT designed and produced by the French manufacturer GIAT (renamed Nexter) and named in honor of General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, the commander of the Free French 2nd Armoured Division that advanced on Paris in World War II ["}

Si bien la fecha límite de cambio de EE. UU. El 17 de febrero se retiró al 12 de junio de 2009 y solo se aplicó a las estaciones con licencia estadounidense en cualquier caso, se anunció que los planes hicieron voluntariamente la programación en inglés de la estación solo digital. La señal analógica se reutilizaría para retransmitir la red mexicana Galavisión (que no debe confundirse con el canal de cable estadounidense del mismo nombre). Las afirmaciones en el sitio web de XETV de que la estación iba a transmitir una señal digitalmente exclusiva se rescindió el 17 de febrero de 2009, ya que la estación decidió retrasar su señal analógica hasta después de que obtuvo la aprobación del gobierno mexicano. XETV Management más tarde declaró que había decidido mantener su señal analógica para beneficiar a los espectadores mexicanos. La señal analógica de XETV finalmente se reutilizó el 5 de marzo de 2012, cuando la estación comenzó a multidifusión en su señal digital con la adición de la red Canal 5 orientada a la juventud de Televisa en el subcanal 6.2 y en su feed analógico, mientras que el canal digital 6.1 conservó las noticias, la red CW y los programas sindicados en inglés. En la misma fecha, XHBJ-TV Channel 45 dejó caer el canal 5 para Galavisión. Canal 5 reemplazó la programación en inglés de XETV en su señal analógica, para servir a los espectadores de habla hispana en Tijuana que no tenían televisores con sintonizadores digitales incorporados o cajas de convertidores digitales antes de la transición de 2013 del mercado de Tijuana a la televisión digital. El cambio de afiliación coincidió con el comienzo de la multidifusión digital en las estaciones de Tijuana de Televisa. Canal 5 se trasladó a su canal primario el 31 de mayo de 2017, momento en el que el subcanal 6.2 fue desmantelado.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: XETV-TDT\nContent: Because XETV-TDT is licensed to Tijuana by the Mexican government, it is not covered under the FCC's must carry rules. This means that local cable providers are not required to carry XETV-TDT, even if the television station requests to be carried under this provision. As an English-language station XETV had been carried by Cox Communications, Time Warner Cable (now Charter Spectrum) and AT&T U-verse in San Diego, all on channel 6. KFMB-TV's \"The CW San Diego\" has replaced XETV on the American cable systems, as well as satellite television providers DirecTV and Dish Network. XETV is carried by all Mexican cable systems in its coverage area, as carriage of local broadcast stations is mandated by the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT).\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Does XETV-TDT have a website?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Yes, XETV-TDT does have an official website; this is evidenced by the fact that “claims on XETV's website that the station was indeed going to transmit a digitally-exclusive signal were rescinded on 17 February 2009,” proving that the station maintained an online presence to publish and later retract such information ["}

After the elder Snart insults him and his mother, calling them weak, Cold punches him, but finds himself unable to kill him, instead getting Heat Wave to do it. The Rogues have their confrontation with Inertia, despite interference by Zoom and Libra, and kill Inertia. Libra then reveals that he needs the Rogues because Barry Allen has returned from the dead, and the Flashes are potential threats to him and Darkseid. Though shocked by the news that Allen is alive, Cold still rejects his offer of membership. After regrouping, Cold and the other Rogues agree not to retire, claiming that the game is back on.

Bilbo Baggins encontró el anillo y lo tomó por el suyo, y Gollum luego lo persiguió por el resto de su vida.

At his wits' end in the dark, Bilbo agreed to a riddle game with Gollum on the chance of being shown the way out of the mountains. In the first edition of \"The Hobbit\", Gollum's size is not stated. Only in the revised version is it specified that he is small and is actually an unnaturally long-lived Hobbit. Originally he was also characterized as being less bound to the Ring than in later versions; he offered to give the Ring to Bilbo if he lost the riddle game, and he showed Bilbo the way out of the mountains after losing. To fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien revised later editions of \"The Hobbit\": The version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the Dwarves and Gandalf. In the new version Gollum pretended that he would show Bilbo the way out if he lost the riddle-game, but he actually planned to use the Ring to kill and eat the hobbit. Discovering the Ring missing, he suddenly realized the answer to Bilbo's last riddle – \"What have I got in my pocket?\" – and flew into a rage. Bilbo inadvertently discovered the Ring's power of invisibility as he fled, allowing him to follow Gollum undetected to a back entrance of the caves. Gollum was convinced that Bilbo knew the way out all along, and hoped to intercept him near the entrance, lest the goblins apprehend Bilbo and find the Ring. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum in order to escape, but was overcome with pity, and so merely leaped over him. As Bilbo escaped, Gollum cried out, \"Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!\"\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Did Gollum know Bilbo before he was turned?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: No; by the time Bilbo Baggins encountered him, Gollum had already spent centuries under the Ring’s corrupting influence—his body and mind were “twisted” long before Bilbo discovered the Ring in the dark of the Misty Mountains—so the two never knew each other prior to Gollum’s transformation ["}

There was a second alleged attack on August 4, which was later shown to be a falsehood. These attacks, and the ensuing naval actions, known as the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, were seized upon by President Lyndon Johnson to secure passage by the U.S. Congress of the Southeast Asia Resolution (better known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution) on 7 August 1964, leading to a dramatic escalation of the Vietnam War. It has since been alleged that the Gulf of Tonkin Incident was partly a fabrication, including testimony by participants, such as squadron commander James Stockdale, in the events themselves. Even the attacks that did happen were not unprovoked, but a result of the OPLAN 34A raids, which was in essence an American operation.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Where is the Gulf of Tonkin?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The Gulf of Tonkin is a northwestern extension of the South China Sea situated off the coast of northern Vietnam and southern China; it is bordered on the west by Vietnam’s northern shoreline, on the north by China’s Guangxi province, and on the east by China’s Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island ["}

From there the road passes by Fredericksburg Country Club, Shannon Airport and the Fredericksburg Agricultural Fairgrounds. Within the city limits, Tidewater Trail becomes Dixon Street and crosses under the Blue and Gray Parkway interchange, then curves right before splitting onto southbound Princess Anne Street and northbound Caroline Street. Both streets cross under the Fredericksburg (VRE station), where US BUS 1 joins US BUS 17 along the same parallel one-way streets, until they reach Herndon Street and become a two-way street again at Princess Anne Street.

VA 14 multiplexes with US 17 Business on the northern leg back to US 17. Main Street is likely a former alignment of US Route 17, due to several US 17 shields on it that lack a Business banner.\nU.S. Route 17 Business in Saluda branches off of mainline US 17 (Tidewater Trail) to the northeast at Gloucester Road along with a concurrency with Virginia State Route 33. One block after the wye Virginia Secondary Route 618 joins the two routes from the intersection of Lovers Retreat Lane. At the intersection of General Puller Highway VA 33 turns right SSR 618 continues north onto Oakes Landing Road and BUS US 17 turns left. This segment also contains the name \"School Street,\" and runs west until reaching mainline US 17 once again.\nU.S. Business Route 17 through the vicinity of Fredericksburg, begins at the intersection of US 17 and Virginia State Route 2 southeast of Fredericksburg, where they both become Tidewater Trail. From there the road passes by Fredericksburg Country Club, Shannon Airport and the Fredericksburg Agricultural Fairgrounds. Within the city limits, Tidewater Trail becomes Dixon Street and crosses under the Blue and Gray Parkway interchange, then curves right before splitting onto southbound Princess Anne Street and northbound Caroline Street. Both streets cross under the Fredericksburg (VRE station), where US BUS 1 joins US BUS 17 along the same parallel one-way streets, until they reach Herndon Street and become a two-way street again at Princess Anne Street. US Bus 1 & 17 continues to run northwest until they reach US 1 where US BUS 1 terminates, but US BUS 17 joins and cross the Rappahannock River, and enters Falmouth. US BUS 17 leaves US 1 at the west end of Virginia State Route 218 where it runs northwest onto Warrenton Road before finally terminating at the north end of the I-95/US 17 multiplex at Exit 133-B.\nU.S. Business Route 17 in Warrenton, Virginia is also multiplexed with U.S. Business Route 15 and U.S. Business Route 29, at least at the southern end. After James Madison Highway becomes Shirley Avenue, US Bus 15 leaves this concurrency at Falmouth Street.
