La antigua provincia de Bengala se dividió en dos nuevas provincias \"Bengala\" (que comprende Bengala Occidental, así como la provincia de Bihar y Orissa) y el este de Bengala y Assam con Dacca como la capital de este último. La partición fue promovida por razones administrativas: Bengala era geográficamente tan grande como Francia y tenía una población significativamente mayor. Curzon declaró que la región oriental fue descuidada y no gobernada. Al dividir la provincia, se podría establecer una administración mejorada en el Este, donde posteriormente, la población se beneficiaría de nuevas escuelas y oportunidades de empleo. Los hindúes de Bengala Occidental que dominaron los negocios y la vida rural de Bengala se quejaron de que la división los convertiría en una minoría en una provincia que incorporará la provincia de Bihar y Orissa.

Los tres ángeles que habían adornado la lámpara del santuario y dos candelabros, aunque en medio del incendio, lograron sobrevivir al infierno. Estos también son parte de la nueva iglesia. El monumento del Sagrado Corazón también sobrevivió milagrosamente al incendio a pesar de que estaba muy cerca de la iglesia. No fue hasta 1986 que la nueva iglesia fue construida y lista para su uso. La orientación del nuevo edificio es revertido de lo que era el anterior. Las nuevas iglesias \"frontal\" se encuentran en la huella de las viejas iglesias \"traseras\".

Hamilton\nContent: Hamilton dirigió una fiesta de campo de dos hombres en la Antártida (octubre de 1958 a enero de 1959) para el año geofísico internacional, y lanzó una nueva comprensión de la Antártida. Fue el primero en aplicar el nombre de montañas transantárticas (dos años después, formalizadas como montañas transantárticas) a ese rango de 3.500 km. Hamilton reconoció que un gran sector de esta gama contenía rocas graníticas distintivas como el cinturón orogénico Adelaida del sur de Australia. Los fósiles asociados de diversas edades en la Antártida, Australia y África más meridional vincularon aún más estos continentes, y apoyaron explicaciones en la deriva continental. Antes de viajar a la Antártida, Hamilton era lo que luego describió como un \"vagabundo de armario\", consciente de que la geología del hemisferio sur proporcionó evidencia poderosa que favorecía la deriva continental.

In 1964, Bernice Neugarten asserted that satisfaction in old age depended on active maintenance of personal relationships and endeavors.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Teoría de la actividad\nContent: Se mantuvo prácticamente desconocido fuera de la Unión Soviética hasta mediados de la década de 1980, cuando fue recogido por investigadores escandinavos. La primera conferencia internacional sobre teoría de actividades no se llevó a cabo hasta 1986. El primer artículo no soviético citado por Nardi es un artículo de 1987 de Yrjö Engeström: \"Aprendizaje por expandir\". Esto dio como resultado una reformulación de AT. Kuutti señala que el término \"teoría de la actividad\" \"puede usarse en dos sentidos: referirse a la tradición soviética original o referirse a la comunidad internacional de múltiples voces que aplica las ideas originales y desarrollarlas más\".\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was activity theory created?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Havighurst in 1961, making that year its point of creation and formal introduction into gerontological discourse ["}

The triple Xs were back on the company logo and were used on almost all of Pearl's advertisements. The Xs held this significant role to the end of production at the brewery in 2001, when the brewery closed its doors and the company logo was abandoned. As production of Pearl and Pearl Light spun up at Miller's Fort Worth facility, the product logos were redesigned. The updated label does not use the triple Xs, so a significant part of company identity has been virtually eliminated from the Pearl beers. However, Pearl's Country Club malt liquor still displays the XXXs in its logo.\nMany people wonder where the Xs came from, and how were they ever used on beer. In truth, the three Xs are actually a quality rating system. The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century. As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party. The courier's job was to sample beer at inns along the way. If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn's sign or door with a single X. If the inn's beer was deemed good, the sign or door would receive two Xs. A mark on an inn of three Xs meant that the beer inside was excellent, and a must-stop for the royal court as they passed through.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Pearl Brewing Company\nContent: Los triples XS fueron adoptados por la Asociación de Brewing de San Antonio para retratar dos cosas: la alta calidad de sus cervezas y el orgullo que los trabajadores pusieron en sus productos. El Triple XS puede desaparecer de los logotipos de cerveza de compañía y perla, pero no ha desaparecido por completo. En la década de 1960, Pearl absorbió la Compañía de Brewing Goetz e hizo de Country Club Malt Liquor uno de los productos clave de Pearl. Cuando Country Club recibió su único cambio de imagen de productos unos años después de la compra, ganó el Triple XS en su logotipo. Las XS estaban situadas en el centro superior de la corona del logotipo. Country Club todavía se produce hoy, y todavía lleva la marca \"XXX\" de Pearl.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Is Pearl beer still in production?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Yes—while Pearl’s historic San Antonio brewery shut down in 2001, production of Pearl and Pearl Light was transferred to Miller’s facility in Fort Worth, so the brand continues to be brewed even though the original plant and its traditional triple-X logo were retired ["}

Recovery of a nerve after surgical repair depends mainly on the age of the patient. Young children can recover close-to-normal nerve function. In contrast, a patient over 60 years old with a cut nerve in the hand would expect to recover only protective sensation, that is, the ability to distinguish hot/cold or sharp/dull. Many other factors also affect nerve recovery. The use of autologous nerve grafting procedures that involve redirection of regenerative donor nerve fibers into the graft conduit has been successful in restoring target muscle function. Localized delivery of soluble neurotrophic factors may help promote the rate of axon regeneration observed within these graft conduits.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Bloque neurolítico\nContent: Un bloque neurolítico es una forma de bloqueo nervioso que involucra la lesión deliberada de un nervio por congelación o calentamiento (\"neurotomía\") o la aplicación de productos químicos (\"neurólisis\"). Estas intervenciones causan la degeneración de las fibras del nervio y la interferencia temporal (unos pocos meses, generalmente) con la transmisión de señales nerviosas. En estos procedimientos, la delgada capa protectora alrededor de la fibra nerviosa, la lámina basal, se conserva de modo que, a medida que una fibra dañada vuelve a crecer, viaja dentro de su tubo de lámina basal y se conecta con el extremo suelto correcto, y la función se puede restaurar. Corte quirúrgico de un nervio (neurectomía), corta estos tubos de lámina basales, y sin ellos para canalizar las fibras que vuelven a sus conexiones perdidas, con el tiempo se puede desarrollar un neuroma doloroso o un dolor de desaferación. Es por eso que el neurolítico generalmente se prefiere sobre el bloque quirúrgico.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Can you cut a nerve fiber?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Adjunctive strategies like localized delivery of soluble neurotrophic factors are under investigation to accelerate axonal regeneration within grafts ["}

There are many axioms in the production of dentures that must be understood; ignorance of one axiom can lead to failure of the denture. In the vast majority of cases, complete dentures should be comfortable soon after insertion, although almost always at least two adjustment visits are necessary to remove the cause of sore spots. One of the most critical aspects of dentures is that the impression of the denture must be perfectly made and used with perfect technique to make an accurate model of the patient's edentulous (toothless) gums. The dentist or denturist must use a process called border molding to ensure that the denture flanges are properly extended. An array of problems may occur if the final impression of the denture is not made properly. It takes considerable patience and experience for a dentist to know how to make a denture, and for this reason it may be in the patient's best interest to seek a specialist, either a prosthodontist or denturist, to make the denture. A denturist is a trained and licensed professional who sees patients in need of dentures, partials, relines or repairs. A denturist not only takes the impression, but makes the entire denture in his or her own laboratory. The denturist then schedules a date for the delivery of the finished dentures to the patient. A general dentist may do a good job making dentures, but only if he or she is meticulous and experienced. Many dentists no longer make dentures themselves. but instead take an impression of the patients' mouth and then either send the impressions to a dental laboratory, which could be anywhere in the world, or send the patient to a denturist. Once the laboratory receives dental impressions of the patient's mouth, the laboratory creates plaster molds from them. The laboratory uses the molds to create the wax rims used to register the patient's bite. These wax rims are returned to the dentist, who uses them to register the patient's bite. The dentist may assist the patient in choosing the correct size of teeth for the dentures, or simply make the selection himself. Once bite registration is completed and the teeth are selected for the dentures, the wax rim is usually returned to the dental laboratory in order to have the denture teeth set into the wax. Once the teeth are set into the wax rim, the result is a prefinished denture that looks almost like the finished product. This prefinished denture is usually returned to the dentist's office and the patient usually has a chance to approve the setup (for immediate or standard dentures) or to try the denture before it is finished. After approval by the patient, the dentist returns the pre-denture to the laboratory for final processing. The finished denture is then returned to the dentist's office for delivery to the patient.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Limpiador de dientes\nContent: Un limpiador de dentaduras postizas (también denominada limpiador de dentaduras postizas) es un limpiador que se usa para limpiar las dentaduras postizas cuando están fuera de la boca. Su uso principal es controlar el crecimiento de microorganismos en las dentaduras postizas, especialmente \"Candida albicans\", evitando así la estomatitis relacionada con la dentadura postiza. Cuando se usan dentaduras postizas en la boca, se desarrolla una biopelícula que puede ser similar a la placa dental. Puede endurecerse y mineralizado como cálculo dental.

Las leonas con cachorros propios tienen más probabilidades de ser tolerantes con los cachorros de otra leona que las leonas sin cachorros. La tolerancia masculina de los Cachorros varía: a veces un hombre dejará que los Cachorros jueguen con la cola o su melena, mientras que otro puede gruñir y golpear a los cachorros.\nEl destete ocurre después de seis o siete meses. Los leones masculinos alcanzan la madurez a los tres años y a los cuatro o cinco años son capaces de desafiar y desplazar a los hombres adultos asociados con otro orgullo. Comienzan a envejecer y se debilitan entre los 10 y 15 años a más tardar. Cuando uno o más hombres nuevos expulsan a los hombres anteriores asociados con un orgullo, los vencedores a menudo matan a cualquier cachorro joven existente, tal vez porque las hembras no se vuelven fértiles y receptivas hasta que sus cachorros maduren o mueran. Las hembras a menudo defienden ferozmente a sus cachorros de un hombre usurpado, pero rara vez tienen éxito a menos que un grupo de tres o cuatro madres dentro de un orgullo unan fuerzas contra el hombre. Los cachorros también mueren por hambre y abandono, y depredación de leopardos, hienas y perros salvajes.

The network aired game shows in a 24-hour cycle, and also used live interstitials as wraparound programming. In its first few months, GSN's commercials consisted of public service announcements (PSAs), promotions for its programming and commercials related to network parent company Sony. By 1995, when the network began to expand, the network began accepting conventional advertising as it gained new sponsorships. On March 17, 1997, the Game Show Network rebranded with a new presentation package and a new logo (which had the network's name in boxes and a colorful swirling ball) and a new slogan \"All Play, All Day\".

Specialty drugs are often biologics—\"drugs derived from living cells\" that are injectable or infused (although some are oral medications). They are used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, H.I.V. psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and hepatitis C. In 1990 there were 10 specialty drugs on the market, in the mid-1990s there were fewer than 30, by 2008 there were 200, and by 2015 there were 300. Drugs are often defined as specialty because their price is much higher than that of non-specialty drugs. Medicare defines any drug for which the negotiated price is $670 per month or more, as a specialty drug which is placed in a specialty tier that requires a higher patient cost sharing. Drugs are also identified as specialty when there is a special handling requirement or the drug is only available via a limited distributions network. By 2015 \"specialty medications accounted for one-third of all spending on drugs in the United States, up from 19 percent in 2004 and heading toward 50 percent in the next 10 years\", according to IMS Health, which tracks prescriptions. According to a 2010 article in Forbes, specialty drugs for rare diseases became more expensive \"than anyone imagined\" and their success came \"at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses\" was \"in decline\". In 2015 analysis by \"The Wall Street Journal\" suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Drogas especializadas en los Estados Unidos\nContent: El 27 de septiembre de 2007, el presidente George W.

Tradition tells of their further journeyings from Hawaiki to New Zealand, and some commentators have identified this homeland as Havai'i, an island in the Society Group. Overpopulation, scarcity of food and civil war forced many of them to migrate once more, and New Zealand became their new home. Māori settled New Zealand between AD 1280–1320. They quickly learnt to hunt the numerous species of moa and seals in New Zealand and settled across the North and South islands in less than a few decades.

Los holandeses también fueron los primeros no nativos en explorar y trazar la costa de Nueva Zelanda. El Capitán James Cook, quien llegó a Nueva Zelanda en octubre de 1769 en el primero de sus tres viajes, fue el primer explorador europeo en circunnavegar y mapear Nueva Zelanda. Desde finales del siglo XVIII, el país fue visitado regularmente por exploradores y otros marineros, misioneros, comerciantes y aventureros. En 1840, el Tratado de Waitangi se firmó entre la corona británica y varios jefes maoríes, trayendo Nueva Zelanda al Imperio Británico y dando a los maoríes los mismos derechos que los sujetos británicos. Hubo un extenso asentamiento británico durante el resto del siglo y en la primera parte del próximo siglo. La guerra y la imposición de un sistema económico y legal europeo condujeron a la mayoría de las tierras de Nueva Zelanda que pasaron de la propiedad maorí a Pākehā (europea), y la mayoría de los maoríes posteriormente se empobrecieron.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was New Zealand first settled?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Archaeological and traditional evidence indicate that the first human settlement of New Zealand occurred when Polynesian ancestors of the Māori arrived between AD 1280 and 1320, marking the beginning of continuous habitation in the islands ["}

Swift se había comprometido a traducir la correspondencia francesa del Templo, pero el Templo, o alguien cercano al templo, editó el texto francés para hacer que el templo parezca profético y más fluido. En consecuencia, las cartas y las traducciones que Swift proporcionó no dio en cuenta y, dado que Swift no pudo acusar al templo de falsificar sus cartas, y porque el público nunca creería que el ministro de Estado retirado había mentido, Swift pareció incompetente.\nA pesar de que Swift publicó el \"cuento\" cuando dejó el servicio de Templo, fue concebido antes, y el libro es una salva en una de las batallas de Temple. La polémica general de Swift se refiere a una discusión (la \"disputa de los antiguos y los modernos\") que había terminado durante casi diez años cuando se publicó el libro. La \"disputa de los antiguos y los modernos\" fue un debate académico francés de principios de la década de 1690, ocasionado por Fontenelle argumentando que la erudición moderna había permitido al hombre moderno superar a los antiguos en conocimiento. Temple argumentó en contra de esta posición en su \"sobre el aprendizaje antiguo y moderno\" (donde proporcionó la primera formulación inglesa del lugar común que los críticos modernos ven más solo porque son enanos parados sobre los hombros de los gigantes), y el ensayo algo ingenuo de Temple provocó una pequeña ranura de respuestas. Entre otros, dos hombres que tomaron el equipo opuesto fueron Richard Bentley (clasicista y editor) y William Wotton (crítico).\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Where was Jonathan Swift born?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, on 30 November 1667 ["}

A pesar de los grandes problemas financieros, la escuela del coro abrió el 5 de octubre de 1901 con once coristas de niños, en el edificio originalmente destinado a los monjes benedictinos. El cardenal Vaughan recibió a los niños con las palabras \"Usted es la base\". El coro de la catedral fue instituido oficialmente tres meses después en enero de 1902. Las masas y oficinas cantadas se establecieron inmediatamente cuando la catedral abrió para adorar en 1903, y continuaron sin interrupción desde entonces. Hoy, el coro de la Catedral de Westminster es el único coro católico profesional en el mundo en cantar misa y vísperas diarias.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who designed Westminster Cathedral?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Westminster Cathedral was designed by the English architect John Francis Bentley, who is also credited with designing the building of Sacred Heart High School in Hammersmith ["}

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from spontaneous generation.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Universidad de Toronto\nContent: El descubrimiento de la insulina en la Universidad de Toronto en 1921 se considera entre los eventos más importantes en la historia de la medicina. La célula madre se descubrió en la Universidad en 1963, formando la base para el trasplante de médula ósea y todas las investigaciones posteriores sobre células madre adultas y embrionarias. Este fue el primero de muchos hallazgos en Toronto relacionados con las células madre, incluida la identificación de células madre pancreáticas y retinianas. La célula madre del cáncer fue identificada por primera vez en 1997 por investigadores de Toronto, que desde entonces han encontrado asociaciones de células madre en leucemia, tumores cerebrales y cáncer colorrectal. Las invenciones médicas desarrolladas en Toronto incluyen el índice glucémico, el pablum de cereales infantiles, el uso de hipotermia protectora en cirugía de corazón abierto y el primer marcapasos cardíaco artificial. El primer trasplante de pulmón único exitoso se realizó en Toronto en 1981, seguido por el primer trasplante nervioso en 1988, y el primer trasplante de doble pulmón en 1989. Los investigadores identificaron el factor de promoción de maduración que regula la división celular y descubrió el receptor de células T, que desencadena las respuestas del sistema inmune. Se le atribuye a la universidad a aislar los genes que causan anemia fanconi, fibrosis quística y enfermedad de Alzheimer de inicio temprano, entre muchas otras enfermedades. Entre 1914 y 1972, la Universidad operó los Laboratorios de Investigación Médica Connaught, ahora parte de la Corporación Pharmacéutica Sanofi-Aventis.

One proposed explanation for this dearth of cloud features is that Uranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low internal thermal flux. Why Uranus's heat flux is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun. Uranus, by contrast, radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere. In fact, Uranus's heat flux is only  W/m², which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 0.075 W/m². The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49 K (−224 °C), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System, colder than Neptune.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Urano\nContent: El calor interno de Urano parece notablemente más bajo que el de los otros planetas gigantes; En términos astronómicos, tiene un flujo térmico bajo.

He designed over 400 building projects and subdivisions, many of them iconic examples of Modernist architecture. Since his focus was on improving the quality of life of the general population, the structures he built were beautiful, useful, and cost-effective. Most of his projects were in the category of social architecture: affordable homes, senior housing projects, public housing, hospitals, medical clinics, public schools, community colleges, community centers, churches, buildings for credit unions, labor unions, and headquarters offices for Rural Electric Associations. As a planner Sternberg designed a number of innovative housing subdivisions and master plans for college campuses, governmental complexes, county fairgrounds, and a number of small western cities.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Eugene Sternberg\nContent: Sternberg nació durante la Primera Guerra Mundial en Pressburg, Austria-Hungría, donde su familia se había movido para estar con su padre mientras servía en el ejército austrohúngaro.

La principal pasión de Sternberg era el arte. Se convirtió en un joven artista consumado y ganó un lugar codiciado para estudiar arquitectura en la Universidad Técnica Checa en Praga. En los veranos trabajó para dos firmas de arquitectura en Munkács y para un conocido arquitecto checo, Frantisek Libra, en Praga. En 1938, obtuvo un primer título en arquitectura/ingeniería. La Alemania de Adolf Hitler ocupó Checoslovaquia en marzo de 1939.

His son Felipe VI is the current monarch. \nThe 1978 constitution confirms the title of the monarch is the \"King of Spain\", but that he may also use other titles historically associated with the Crown,\nincluding the kingdoms of Castile and León, Aragon, the Two Sicilies, Jerusalem, Navarre, Granada, Seville, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia, Sardinia, Córdoba, Corsica, etc.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Alfonso xii de España\nContent: Hasta la fecha, él es el último monarca de España que murió mientras estaba en el trono.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who was the last ruling monarch of Spain?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Felipe VI is the last—and current—ruling monarch of Spain, having succeeded his father Juan Carlos I after the latter’s abdication in 2014, and he presently bears the constitutionally recognised title “King of Spain,” under the 1978 constitution that confirms the monarchy’s restoration ["}

Vigilantism arose because territorial law enforcement and the courts had very little power in the remote mining camps during the territorial period.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Montana vigilantes\nContent: El primer relato escrito de los vigilantes fue \"Vigilantes of Montana\" de Thomas Dimsdale, que apareció por primera vez como una serie de artículos en 1865 ediciones del \"Montana Post\", el primer periódico de Virginia City y Montana. Dimsdale fue miembro del Comité de Vigilancia Alder Gulch y editor del \"Montana Post\". Sus primeros relatos de los eventos de Alder Gulch Vigilante son ampliamente citados y la versión del libro de sus artículos, el primer libro publicado en el territorio de Montana en 1866, ha sido ampliamente reimpreso desde su primera edición. X. Biedler, uno de los exigentes de Alder Gulch y Helena Vigilante escribió sobre sus actividades vigilantes en sus diarios personales. They weren't available until well after his death when Helen F. Sanders, the daughter-in-law of Wilbur Sanders finally got them published in 1957. Nathaniel Langford, also a member of the vigilantes, explorer of the upper Yellowstone (1870), first superintendent of Yellowstone National Park (1872–1877), territorial tax collector (1864–1869) and author published \"Vigilante Days y por los caminos de los Rockies \"en 1893 después de regresar a su casa en Minnesota. En un discurso de 1912 ante la Sociedad Histórica de Montana, el historiador occidental, Olin Wheeler, proporcionó comentarios positivos sobre los vigilantes Alder Gulch en un homenaje a la vida de Nathaniel Langford. Otra cuenta, no publicada hasta 1982, es la del ex juez de la Corte Suprema de Montana (1922–1935) Lew L. Callaway. Editado por su hijo Lew Callaway Jr., \"Montana's Justice Hangmen: The Vigilantes in Action\" proviene de la asociación de Callaway con el capitán de vigilante James William a fines del siglo XIX. Lew Callaway escribió extensamente sobre los vigilantes y sus historias que agregan detalles más íntimos sobre cómo operados los vigilantes se capturan en este volumen. Aunque algunas actividades de vigilancia durante este período fueron criticadas por ciudadanos y líderes cívicos, hubo una afirmación general de su propósito y contribución a la ley y el orden en un territorio creciente. Marca El \"Montana vigilantes de Dillon 1863–1870 de oro, armas y galardonas\" (2013) concluye que, dada el entorno sin ley y la actividad criminal en Alder Gulch y Helena en la época, la falta de cualquier sistema de justicia en funcionamiento y la comprensión del debido proceso en el momento, las vigilantes actuaban de una manera que creían que eran mejores para sus comunidades. Sostiene que juzgar a los vigilantes por la comprensión y los estándares del debido proceso actual es problemático. En 2004, Frederick Allen, periodista e historiador, publicó \"Un linchamiento decente y ordenado: los vigilantes de Montana\" revisado como un relato equilibrado de la historia vigilante de Montana (1864-1870). El libro de Allen refuerza las motivaciones y métodos de los primeros vigilantes en Alder Gulch mientras comenta sobre el creciente desdén por el vigilantismo a fines de la década de 1860. Más generalista trabaja en la historia de Montana como \"The Montana Frontier\" (1942) de Merrill G. Burlingame (1942) y \"Montana-A History of Dwe Siglo\" (1991) de Michael P. Malone (1991) resumen adecuadamente el período vigilante basado en gran medida en cuentas anteriores de Dimsdale, Langford y Biedler.

Las cuerdas sin masa, las partículas puntuales, los gases ideales y la partícula en una caja se encuentran entre los muchos modelos simplificados utilizados en la física. Las leyes de la física están representadas con ecuaciones simples como las leyes de Newton, las ecuaciones de Maxwell y la ecuación de Schrödinger. Estas leyes son tales como una base para hacer modelos matemáticos de situaciones reales. Muchas situaciones reales son muy complejas y, por lo tanto, se modelan aproximadas en una computadora, un modelo que es computacionalmente factible para calcular las leyes básicas o de modelos aproximados hechos de las leyes básicas. Por ejemplo, las moléculas pueden ser modeladas por modelos orbitales moleculares que son soluciones aproximadas a la ecuación de Schrödinger.

The magnetic field is generated by electric currents due to the motion of convection currents of molten iron in the Earth's outer core driven by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a geodynamo.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Fuerza\nContent: donde la fórmula_48 es la magnitud de la corriente de prueba hipotética y la fórmula_49 es la longitud del cable hipotético a través del cual fluye la corriente de prueba.

Hominidae, including humans and chimpanzees, are also omnivores.\nMost bear species are omnivores, but individual diets can range from almost exclusively herbivorous to almost exclusively carnivorous, depending on what food sources are available locally and seasonally. Polar bears are classified as carnivores, both taxonomically (they are in the order Carnivora), and behaviorally (they subsist on a largely carnivorous diet). Depending on the species of bear, there is generally a preference for one class of food, as plants and animals are digested differently. Wolf subspecies (including wolves, dogs, dingoes, and coyotes) eat some plant matter, but they have a general preference and are evolutionarily geared towards meat. Also, the maned wolf is a canid whose diet is naturally 50% plant matter.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Cueva del ángel\nContent: Es notable la ausencia casi completa de carnívoros, que solo están representados por unos pocos huesos de \"Ursus Arctos\", \"Lynx Pardinus\" y \"Canis lupus\".

Inspirados por ellos, se desarrollan métodos de polimerización, utilizando ADN o ARN como plantillas para controlar secuencias de polímero. Al principio, tomando ADN o ARN como plantillas, los científicos desarrollaron una serie de polímeros basados ​​en el ácido nucleico peptídico (PNA), sin usar ADN polimerasas. Pero este método se limita a la escala de polimerización y al rendimiento. Después de eso, se desarrolla la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR), que actualmente sigue siendo el método regulado por secuencia más ampliamente utilizado. Al emplear enzimas, los rendimientos y las escalas aumentan considerablemente, pero la especificidad de las enzimas hacia los péptidos naturales limita esta técnica hasta cierto punto. Hoy en día, se presta más atención a la utilización de ribosomas para imitar directamente el proceso de transcripción y traducción.

Butler pasó siete años en la India hasta su muerte en 1889 y abrió dispensarios médicos en Srinagar y Bhagalpur, donde no habían existido instalaciones médicas previamente. Butler también inició la construcción del primer hospital en Srinagar en 1888 llamado Hospital John Bishop Memorial y brindó atención médica necesaria para las mujeres indias, para quienes había estado disponible poco atención.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who is the first female Doctor?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Elizabeth Blackwell (1821–1910) is recognized as the first female doctor, having become the first woman in the United States to earn a medical degree and later the first woman listed on the General Medical Council’s Medical Register in the United Kingdom ["}

When the trigger is pulled, the rate at which rounds are fired is the cyclic rate. Typical cyclic rates of fire are 600–900 RPM for assault rifles, 1,000-1,100 RPM in some cases, 900-1,200 RPM for submachine guns and machine pistols, and 600-1,500 RPM for machine guns.

Cada vez se mide por debajo de un segundo, desde la señal para dibujar hasta cuando se detiene el temporizador. El récord actual de la Asociación Mundial de Draw de Draw (WFDA) para el sorteo rápido de clase abierta en un evento llamado globos en pie es .208 segundos, y eso incluye el tiempo que lleva reaccionar, dibujar, disparar y hacer estallar un objetivo global a ocho pies de distancia. Un competidor de clase mundial puede dibujar y disparar en menos de medio segundo. Dado que el tiempo de reacción humana promedio es de alrededor de 0.2 a 0.25 segundos, la ronda termina antes de que la mayoría de las personas puedan reaccionar. Los tiempos de reacción de los mejores tiradores de dibujo rápido son 0.145 segundos, lo que significa que la pistola está ladeada, dibujada, dirigida (desde la cadera) y se dispara en poco más de 0.06 segundos. Para establecer un récord mundial de asociación de sorteo, se debe disparar en la misma competencia que no es más de 0.30 segundos más lento que el primero; Esto está destinado a evitar una toma que anticipe que la señal de inicio establece un registro.

His work was initially on the propagation of acoustic waves in water, motivated by the sinking of the Titanic by an iceberg in 1912. He also worked on methods of detecting submarines during World War I. He applied for the first patent on a seismic exploration method in 1914, which was issued in 1917. Due to the war, he was unable to follow up on the idea. John Clarence Karcher discovered seismic reflections independently while working for the United States Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) on methods of sound ranging to detect artillery. In discussion with colleagues, the idea developed that these reflections could aid in exploration for petroleum. With several others, many affiliated with the University of Oklahoma, Karcher helped to form the Geological Engineering Company, incorporated in Oklahoma in April, 1920. The first field tests were conducted near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1921.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Sismología de reflexión\nContent: La sismología de la reflexión (o la reflexión sísmica) es un método de exploración geofísica que utiliza los principios de la sismología para estimar las propiedades del subsuelo de la Tierra a partir de ondas sísmicas reflejadas. El método requiere una fuente sísmica controlada de energía, como la dinamita o la explosión de Tovex, una pistola de aire especializada o un vibrador sísmico, comúnmente conocido por el nombre de marca registrada Vibroseis. La sismología de reflexión es similar a la sonar y la ecolocalización. Este artículo trata sobre encuestas sísmicas de superficie; Para los perfiles sísmicos verticales, ver vsp.\nPrimero se observaron reflexiones y refracciones de ondas sísmicas en interfaces geológicas dentro de la Tierra en grabaciones de ondas sísmicas generadas por terremotos. El modelo básico del interior profundo de la Tierra se basa en observaciones de ondas sísmicas generadas por terremotos transmitidas a través del interior de la Tierra (por ejemplo, Mohorovičić, 1910). El uso de ondas sísmicas generadas por humanos para mapear en detalle la geología de los pocos kilómetros superiores de la corteza terrestre siguió poco después y se ha desarrollado principalmente debido a la empresa comercial, particularmente la industria del petróleo.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who first developed reflection seismology?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Fessenden is credited as the first developer of reflection seismology, having conceived the idea of using reflected seismic waves to infer subsurface geology, applied for the initial seismic exploration patent in 1914 (issued 1917), and carried out early research on acoustic‐wave propagation following the Titanic disaster of 1912 and during World War I submarine‐detection work ["}

Legend claims that Rugby football was started around the time of 1845 in Rugby School, Rugby, Warwickshire, England, although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times. Rugby eventually split into two sports in 1895 when twenty one clubs split from the original Rugby Football Union, to form the Northern Union (later to be named rugby league in 1922) in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, Northern England over the issue of payment to players, thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay its players, rugby union turned fully professional in 1995. Both sports are run by their respective world governing bodies World Rugby (rugby union) and the Rugby League International Federation (rugby league). Rugby football was one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports. In addition to these two codes, both American and Canadian football evolved from rugby football.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Camino de rugby\nContent: Una parte integral de Rugby Road es \"Beta Bridge\".

Se utilizó tan lejos como en China, durante las guerras civiles chinas, y las versiones del tanque fueron utilizadas tanto contra y por los japoneses durante la invasión de China. Un gran número se abrió camino en las manos republicanas y nacionalistas durante la Guerra Civil española. Fueron utilizados en la revolución rusa tanto por los bolcheviques como por los rusos blancos, y más tarde por los finlandeses contra los soviéticos.

Louis XIV encargó a su arquitecto Le Vau y su arquitecto paisajista Le Nôtre para transformar el castillo de su padre, así como el parque, para acomodar a la corte. En 1678, después del Tratado de Nijmegen, el Rey decidió que el Tribunal y el Gobierno se establecerían permanentemente en Versalles, que ocurrió el 6 de mayo de 1682.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was Louis XIV king?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Louis XIV ascended the French throne on 14 May 1643, when he was four years old, and remained king until his death on 1 September 1715, giving him a reign of about 72 years and 110 days—the longest recorded of any sovereign monarch in European history ["}

While the U.S. switchover deadline of 17 February was later pushed back to 12 June 2009 and only applied to American-licensed stations in any case, plans were announced to voluntarily make the station's English-language programming digital-only. The analog signal would be repurposed to retransmit the Mexican Galavisión network (not to be confused with the American cable channel of the same name). Claims on XETV's website that the station was indeed going to transmit a digitally-exclusive signal were rescinded on 17 February 2009 as the station decided to delay cutting off its analog signal until after it secured approval from the Mexican government. XETV management later stated that it had decided to maintain its analog signal to benefit Mexican viewers. XETV's analog signal was eventually repurposed on 5 March 2012, when the station began multicasting on its digital signal with the addition of Televisa's youth-oriented Canal 5 network on subchannel 6.2 and on its analog feed, while digital channel 6.1 retained the newscasts, CW network and syndicated programs in English. On the same date, XHBJ-TV channel 45 dropped Canal 5 for Galavisión. Canal 5 replaced XETV's English-language programming on its analog signal, in order to serve Spanish-speaking viewers in Tijuana that did not have television sets with built-in digital tuners or digital converter boxes prior to the Tijuana market's 2013 transition to digital television. The affiliation switch coincided with the commencement of digital multicasting on Televisa's Tijuana stations. Canal 5 moved to its primary channel on 31 May 2017, at which point, the 6.2 subchannel was decommissioned.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Xetv-tdt\nContent: Debido a que el gobierno mexicano tiene licencia a Xetv-TDT a Tijuana, no está cubierto por las reglas de la FCC.

However, efforts to rebuild the carrier force were unsuccessful since the training given to new aviators was of a very low standard. Consequently, the new carriers never went to sea with a full air group. This left the Japanese with a ragtag collection of carriers, led by the \"Zuikaku\", which was the sole survivor of the Pearl Harbor attack force. The Japanese were left with two choices, either to commit their remaining strength in an all-out offensive, or to sit by while the Americans occupied the Philippines and cut the sea lanes between Japan and vital resources from the Dutch East Indies and Malaya. The plan devised by the Japanese was a final attempt to create a decisive battle by utilizing their last remaining strength, the firepower of its heavy cruisers and battleships, which were to be all committed against the American beachhead at Leyte. The Japanese planned to use their remaining carriers as bait, in order to lure the American carriers away from Leyte Gulf long enough for the heavy warships to enter and destroy any American ships present.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Tácticas navales en la era del vapor\nContent: Poco después del final de la guerra, se completaron los primeros portaaviones diseñados desde la quilla: los japoneses \"Hōshō\" y los británicos \"Hermes\".

Bilbo Baggins found the Ring and took it for his own, and Gollum afterwards pursued it for the rest of his life.

Al final de su ingenio en la oscuridad, Bilbo acordó un juego de acertijo con Gollum sobre la posibilidad de que salga de las montañas. En la primera edición de \"The Hobbit\", no se establece el tamaño de Gollum. Solo en la versión revisada se especifica que es pequeño y que en realidad es un hobbit de larga vida. Originalmente también se caracterizó por estar menos vinculado al anillo que en versiones posteriores; Se ofreció a dar el anillo a Bilbo si perdió el juego de acertijo, y le mostró a Bilbo la salida de las montañas después de perder. Para adaptarse al concepto del anillo gobernante que surgió durante la escritura de \"El Señor de los Anillos\", Tolkien revisó las ediciones posteriores de \"The Hobbit\": la versión de la historia dada en la primera edición se convirtió en la mentira que Bilbo compensó su posesión de el anillo a los Dwarves y Gandalf. En la nueva versión, Gollum fingió que le mostraría a Bilbo la salida si perdiera el juego de acertijo, pero en realidad planeó usar el anillo para matar y comer el hobbit. Al descubrir el anillo que faltaba, de repente se dio cuenta de la respuesta al último acertijo de Bilbo: \"¿Qué tengo en mi bolsillo?\" - y voló a una ira. Bilbo descubrió inadvertidamente el poder de invisibilidad del anillo mientras huyó, lo que le permitió seguir a Gollum sin ser detectado hasta una entrada trasera de las cuevas. Gollum estaba convencido de que Bilbo sabía la salida todo el tiempo, y esperaba interceptarlo cerca de la entrada, para que los duendes detengan a Bilbo y encuentren el anillo. Bilbo al principio pensó en matar a Gollum para escapar, pero fue abrumado por la lástima, por lo que simplemente saltó sobre él.

The series is produced by Proper Television, whose president, Guy O'Sullivan, was the director of the original \"Britain's Worst Driver\" series until its cancellation in 2003. O'Sullivan served as executive producer of \"Canada's Worst Driver\" until his death in April 2017, doubling as executive producer of sister series \"Canada's Worst Handyman\" until its cancellation in 2011.

Unlike other \"Worst\" series around the world, where being a graduate is rewarded with a new car while the Worst Driver has their car destroyed, \"Canada's Worst Driver\" emphasizes the learning process of the contestants and the science of driving and is often more serious than any other \"Worst Driver\" version around the world, awarding no prizes aside from a trophy at the end of each season for being named the worst (with the exception of season twelve, in which, despite ultimately being named the worst, Krystal McCann wasn't even worthy of being awarded the trophy, leading to Tyler Dupont becoming the first-ever nominee to be awarded the \"Final Graduate\" trophy), as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain, as other versions are mainly comedic.
