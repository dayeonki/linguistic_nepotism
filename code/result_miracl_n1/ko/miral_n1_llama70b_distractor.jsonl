The triple Xs were back on the company logo and were used on almost all of Pearl's advertisements. The Xs held this significant role to the end of production at the brewery in 2001, when the brewery closed its doors and the company logo was abandoned. As production of Pearl and Pearl Light spun up at Miller's Fort Worth facility, the product logos were redesigned. The updated label does not use the triple Xs, so a significant part of company identity has been virtually eliminated from the Pearl beers. However, Pearl's Country Club malt liquor still displays the XXXs in its logo.\nMany people wonder where the Xs came from, and how were they ever used on beer. In truth, the three Xs are actually a quality rating system. The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century. As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party. The courier's job was to sample beer at inns along the way. If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn's sign or door with a single X. If the inn's beer was deemed good, the sign or door would receive two Xs. A mark on an inn of three Xs meant that the beer inside was excellent, and a must-stop for the royal court as they passed through.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 진주 양조 회사\nContent: Triple XS는 San Antonio Brewing Association에 의해 채택되어 맥주의 고품질과 노동자들이 제품에 넣은 자존심의 두 가지를 묘사했습니다. 트리플 XS는 회사와 진주 맥주 로고에서 사라질 수 있지만 완전히 사라지지 않았습니다. 1960 년대에 Pearl은 Goetz Brewing Company를 흡수하고 Country Club Malt Liquor를 Pearl의 주요 제품 중 하나로 만들었습니다. 컨트리 클럽이 매입 후 몇 년 후 유일한 제품 화장을 받았을 때 로고에서 트리플 XS를 얻었습니다.

There are many axioms in the production of dentures that must be understood; ignorance of one axiom can lead to failure of the denture. In the vast majority of cases, complete dentures should be comfortable soon after insertion, although almost always at least two adjustment visits are necessary to remove the cause of sore spots. One of the most critical aspects of dentures is that the impression of the denture must be perfectly made and used with perfect technique to make an accurate model of the patient's edentulous (toothless) gums. The dentist or denturist must use a process called border molding to ensure that the denture flanges are properly extended. An array of problems may occur if the final impression of the denture is not made properly. It takes considerable patience and experience for a dentist to know how to make a denture, and for this reason it may be in the patient's best interest to seek a specialist, either a prosthodontist or denturist, to make the denture. A denturist is a trained and licensed professional who sees patients in need of dentures, partials, relines or repairs. A denturist not only takes the impression, but makes the entire denture in his or her own laboratory. The denturist then schedules a date for the delivery of the finished dentures to the patient. A general dentist may do a good job making dentures, but only if he or she is meticulous and experienced. Many dentists no longer make dentures themselves. but instead take an impression of the patients' mouth and then either send the impressions to a dental laboratory, which could be anywhere in the world, or send the patient to a denturist. Once the laboratory receives dental impressions of the patient's mouth, the laboratory creates plaster molds from them. The laboratory uses the molds to create the wax rims used to register the patient's bite. These wax rims are returned to the dentist, who uses them to register the patient's bite. The dentist may assist the patient in choosing the correct size of teeth for the dentures, or simply make the selection himself. Once bite registration is completed and the teeth are selected for the dentures, the wax rim is usually returned to the dental laboratory in order to have the denture teeth set into the wax. Once the teeth are set into the wax rim, the result is a prefinished denture that looks almost like the finished product. This prefinished denture is usually returned to the dentist's office and the patient usually has a chance to approve the setup (for immediate or standard dentures) or to try the denture before it is finished. After approval by the patient, the dentist returns the pre-denture to the laboratory for final processing. The finished denture is then returned to the dentist's office for delivery to the patient.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 의치 세정제\nContent: 의치 세정제 (의치 클렌저라고도 함)는 입에서 나올 때 의치를 청소하는 데 사용되는 클리너입니다. 그들의 주요 용도는 의치, 특히 \"칸디다 알비 칸스\"에서 미생물의 성장을 조절하여 의치 관련 구내염을 예방하는 것입니다. 입에 의치가 착용되면 생물막이 발생하여 치과 플라크와 유사 할 수 있습니다. 치과 미적분학으로 경화되고 광물 화 될 수 있습니다. 의치 클렌저는 또한식이 요법, 담배 사용, 커피 마시기, 차 마시는 등에 의해 야기 될 수있는 얼룩과 다른 잔해물을 제거하는 데 사용됩니다.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is a denture specialist called?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: A specialist who focuses on the design, fabrication, and fitting of complete or partial dentures is commonly called a prosthodontist or, in jurisdictions where they are licensed, a denturist; both professionals possess advanced training specifically aimed at producing comfortable, functional dentures and managing related oral-rehabilitation issues ["}

Specialty drugs are often biologics—\"drugs derived from living cells\" that are injectable or infused (although some are oral medications). They are used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, H.I.V. psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and hepatitis C. In 1990 there were 10 specialty drugs on the market, in the mid-1990s there were fewer than 30, by 2008 there were 200, and by 2015 there were 300. Drugs are often defined as specialty because their price is much higher than that of non-specialty drugs. Medicare defines any drug for which the negotiated price is $670 per month or more, as a specialty drug which is placed in a specialty tier that requires a higher patient cost sharing. Drugs are also identified as specialty when there is a special handling requirement or the drug is only available via a limited distributions network. By 2015 \"specialty medications accounted for one-third of all spending on drugs in the United States, up from 19 percent in 2004 and heading toward 50 percent in the next 10 years\", according to IMS Health, which tracks prescriptions. According to a 2010 article in Forbes, specialty drugs for rare diseases became more expensive \"than anyone imagined\" and their success came \"at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses\" was \"in decline\". In 2015 analysis by \"The Wall Street Journal\" suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 미국의 특수 약물\nContent: 2007 년 9 월 27 일 George W.

Māori descend from a race of Polynesian sea-wanderers who, moved from East Asia and south-east Asia to the islands of the Pacific. Tradition tells of their further journeyings from Hawaiki to New Zealand, and some commentators have identified this homeland as Havai'i, an island in the Society Group. Overpopulation, scarcity of food and civil war forced many of them to migrate once more, and New Zealand became their new home. Māori settled New Zealand between AD 1280–1320. They quickly learnt to hunt the numerous species of moa and seals in New Zealand and settled across the North and South islands in less than a few decades. There is a change in the pollen record from inland Otago from 600 years ago from a forest to bracken flora. It has been inferred that this relates to fires being lit during Maori exploration.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 뉴질랜드의 역사\nContent: 뉴질랜드의 역사는 Kinship 링크와 땅을 중심으로 한 독특한 마오리 문화를 개발 한 폴리네시아 사람들이 발견하고 정착 한 시점으로 700 년이 지났습니다. 뉴질랜드의 첫 번째 유럽 탐험가는 1642 년 12 월 13 일 네덜란드 네비게이터 인 Abel Tasman이었습니다. 네덜란드는 또한 뉴질랜드 해안선을 탐험하고 차트로 만든 최초의 비 네이티브였습니다. 1769 년 10 월 그의 3 개 항해 중 첫 번째 항해 중 뉴질랜드에 도착한 제임스 쿡 대위는 뉴질랜드를 우회하고지도 한 최초의 유럽 탐험가였습니다. 18 세기 후반 부터이 나라는 탐험가와 다른 선원, 선교사, 상인 및 모험가가 정기적으로 방문했습니다. 1840 년에 Waitangi 조약은 영국 왕관과 다양한 마오리 교장 사이에 서명하여 뉴질랜드를 대영 제국에 데려오고 마오리에게 영국의 주제와 같은 권리를 부여했습니다. 나머지 세기 동안 그리고 다음 세기 초반에 광범위한 영국 정착촌이있었습니다. 유럽 ​​경제 및 법률 시스템의 전쟁과 부과는 대부분의 뉴질랜드 땅이 마오리에서 파키 (유럽) 소유권으로 지나가고 대부분의 마오리는 빈곤 해졌다.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was New Zealand first settled?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Archaeological and traditional evidence indicate that the first human settlement of New Zealand occurred when Polynesian ancestors of the Māori arrived between AD 1280 and 1320, marking the beginning of continuous habitation in the islands ["}

The Institute's 2015 report \"El español, una lengua viva\" (Spanish, a living language) estimates that there are 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 니카라과 인\nContent: 스페인어는 국가 인구의 약 90%에 의해 사용됩니다. 니카라과에서는 온두라스, 아르헨티나, 우루과이 또는 해안 콜롬비아와 같은 중부 및 남미의 다른 국가에서와 마찬가지로 Voseo 형태는 일반적입니다. 스페인어는 라틴 아메리카 전역에서 사용되는 여러 가지 방언을 가지고 있으며, 중앙 아메리카 스페인어는 니카라과에서 사용되는 방언입니다. 카리브해 해안에서 많은 아프리카-니카라과 인과 크리올은 영어와 크리올 영어를 모국어로 사용합니다. 또한 카리브해 해안에서 많은 토착민들이 Miskito, Sumo, Rama 및 Garifuna 언어와 같은 모국어를 사용합니다. 또한, 중국 니카라과 인과 팔레스타인 니카라과 인들과 같은 니카라과의 많은 민족 그룹은 소수 언어 인 조상 언어를 유지하면서 스페인어 및/또는 영어를 말해주었습니다. 이 소수 민족에는 중국어, 아랍어, 독일어 및 이탈리아어가 포함됩니다.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How many countries speak Spanish?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Spanish is officially spoken in 23 countries, corresponding to the 23 national academies that make up the Association of Spanish Language Academies, including Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and others across Latin America, the Caribbean, the United States, the Philippines, and Equatorial Guinea ["}

Swift와 그의 고용주 사이의 균열을 일으킨 원인에 대한 추측이 있지만 A.C. Elias가 설득력있게 주장하면서 마지막 빨대는 Swift의 Temple의 \"편지\"에 대한 작업과 함께 온 것 같습니다. Swift는 Temple의 프랑스 서신을 번역하기 위해 약혼했지만 Temple, 또는 Temple에 가까운 누군가는 프랑스어 텍스트를 편집하여 성전을 더 유창하고 유창하게 보이게했습니다. 결과적으로, 서한과 번역 된 번역은 곤경에 처하지 않았으며, Swift는 성전을 그의 편지를 위조했다고 비난 할 수 없었기 때문에 대중은 은퇴 한 국무 장관이 거짓말을했다고 결코 믿지 않을 것이기 때문에 Swift는 무능한 것으로 나타났습니다.\nSwift가 Temple의 봉사를 떠날 때 \"이야기\"를 출판했지만 이전에는 고안 되었으며이 책은 Temple의 전투 중 하나의 Salvo입니다. 스위프트의 일반적인 논쟁은이 책이 출판 될 때까지 거의 10 년 동안 끝났던 논쟁 ( \"고대와 현대인의 싸움\")에 관한 것입니다. \"고대인과 현대인의 싸움\"은 1690 년대 초의 프랑스 학문 토론으로, 폰테 넬은 현대 장학금으로 인해 현대인이 고대인을 지식으로 능가 할 수 있다고 주장했다. 템플은 그의 \"고대와 현대 학습에 관한\"(그는 현대 비평가들이 거인의 어깨에 서있는 드워프이기 때문에 더 많은 것을 볼 수있는 평범한 최초의 영어 공식을 제공 한 곳) 에서이 입장에 반대한다고 주장했으며, 성전의 다소 순진한 에세이는 작은 반응의 약간의 반응을 불러 일으켰다. 그중에서도, 반대하는 성전을 밟은 두 남자는 Richard Bentley (클래식리스트 및 편집자)와 William Wotton (비평가)이었습니다.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Where was Jonathan Swift born?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, on 30 November 1667 ["}

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from spontaneous generation.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 토론토 대학교\nContent: 1921 년 토론토 대학에서 인슐린 발견은 의학 역사상 가장 중요한 사건으로 간주됩니다. 줄기 세포는 1963 년 대학에서 발견되어 골수 이식의 기초와 성인 및 배아 줄기 세포에 대한 모든 후속 연구를 형성했습니다. 이것은 췌장 및 망막 줄기 세포의 확인을 포함하여 줄기 세포와 관련하여 토론토에서 많은 발견 중 첫 번째 발견이었습니다. 암 줄기 세포는 1997 년 토론토 연구원들에 의해 처음 확인되었으며, 이후 백혈병, 뇌종양 및 결장 직장암에서 줄기 세포 연관성을 발견했습니다. 토론토에서 개발 된 의료 발명에는 혈당 지수, 유아 시리얼 파블럼, 열린 심장 수술에서의 보호 저체온증 사용 및 최초의 인공 심장 심박 조율기가 포함됩니다. 최초의 성공적인 단일 폐 이식은 1981 년 토론토에서 수행되었으며 1988 년 첫 신경 이식과 1989 년 첫 번째 이중 폐 이식이 이어졌습니다. 연구원들은 세포 분열을 조절하는 성숙 촉진 요인을 확인하고 면역 시스템의 반응을 유발하는 T- 세포 수용체를 발견했습니다. 이 대학은 수많은 다른 질병 중에서 Fanconi 빈혈, 낭성 섬유증 및 초기 발병 알츠하이머 병을 유발하는 유전자를 분리 한 것으로 인정됩니다. 1914 년에서 1972 년 사이에 대학은 현재 제약 회사 인 Sanofi-Aventis의 일부인 Connaugh Medical Research Laboratories를 운영했습니다. 실험실에서 수행 된 연구 중에는 겔 전기 영동의 개발이있었습니다.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who first identified the cell?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Robert Hooke is credited as the first person to identify and describe cells, a discovery he made in the 17th century after improvements in microscope technology allowed him to observe the microscopic structure of cork and coin the term “cell” for the box-like structures he saw ["}

One proposed explanation for this dearth of cloud features is that Uranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low internal thermal flux. Why Uranus's heat flux is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun. Uranus, by contrast, radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere. In fact, Uranus's heat flux is only  W/m², which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 0.075 W/m².

In 1870, he was one of numerous Southern black migrants to Boston, Massachusetts, which had a thriving black community and strong abolitionist history. He later joined the Republican Party that was founded by abolitionists, and Chappelle was elected to two terms in the Massachusetts state legislature, serving 1883-1886. Julius Caesar Chappelle was also the first African-American to serve on the Massachusetts State Senate Committee where he served three terms. Chappelle was active in supporting civil rights, trying to reduce discrimination, and consumer affairs. His speeches were frequently covered by newspapers. Throughout his life and political career, he held secondary supervisory government positions in maintenance, such as at the United States Post Office and US Boston Custom House. Although Julius Caesar Chappelle may have graced the same pages in newspapers as Frederick Douglass, Chappelle is not as well known because he is not known to have left much of a literary footprint such as writing manuscripts or for pamphlets.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 줄리어스 시저 샤펠\nContent: Chappelle 's는 금지 문제로 나뉘어졌으며 Lewis Chappelle, Julius C.

This might be because they come from rural areas of the country where the death penalty is strongly supported, they lack information because it is not a pressing issue and not widely debated, or they simply have no power and are forbidden from making political statements because political authorities are exclusively in control of the government in Thailand. Thailand's war on drugs may potentially explain its current retention of the death penalty. The manufacture and distribution of drugs is considered an offense in which the death penalty is mandatory.

Dimsdale은 Alder Gulch Vigilance Committee의 회원이자 \"Montana Post\"의 편집자였습니다. Alder Gulch Vigilante 사건에 대한 그의 초기 기록은 널리 인용되었으며 1866 년 몬태나 영토에 출판 된 첫 번째 책인 그의 기사 버전은 첫 번째 판 이후 광범위하게 재 인쇄되었습니다. Alder Gulch와 Helena Vigilante 집행자 중 하나 인 X. Biedler는 그의 개인 저널에서 그의 경계 활동에 대해 썼습니다. 윌버 샌더스 (Wilbur Sanders)의 며느리 인 헬렌 F. 샌더스 (Helen F. Sanders)가 1957 년에 출판 될 때까지는 사망 할 수 없었습니다. 옐로 스톤 (1870)의 탐험가 (1870 년), 옐로 스톤 국립 공원 (1872-1877), 테리어 컬렉션 (1864-1869)의 감독관 (1864-1869). 1893 년 그는 미네소타에있는 집으로 돌아온 후 \"경계의 날과 로키스의 길을 열었다\". 1912 년 몬태나 역사 학회 (Montana Historical Society)와의 연설에서 서부 역사가 인 올린 휠러 (Olin Wheeler)는 나다니엘 랭 포드 (Nathaniel Langford)의 삶에 대한 찬사로 알더 굴치 경계에 대한 긍정적 인 논평을 제공했다. 1982 년까지 출판되지 않은 또 다른 설명은 전 몬태나 대법원 법무부 (1922-1935) Lew L. Callaway의 계정입니다. 그의 아들 Lew Callaway Jr.가 편집 한 \"Montana의 의로운 행맨 : The Vigilantes in Action\"은 1800 년대 후반에 Callaway의 Vigilante 선장 James William과의 연관성에서 비롯됩니다. Lew Callaway는 경계와 그의 이야기에 대해 광범위하게 글을 썼는데,이 책은이 책에서 경계가 어떻게 운영되는지에 대한 더 친밀한 세부 사항을 추가합니다. 이 기간 동안 일부 경계 활동은 시민과 시민 지도자들에 의해 비판을 받았지만, 성장하는 영토에서 법과 질서에 대한 그들의 목적과 기여에 대한 일반적인 긍정이있었습니다. 표시 C. Dillon의 \"Montana Vigilantes 1863–1870 Gold, Guns and Gallows\"(2013)는 당시 Alder Gulch와 Helena의 불법 환경과 범죄 활동을 감안할 때, 기능하는 사법 시스템의 부족과 당시 적법한 절차에 대한 이해가 지역 사회에 가장 적합한 방식으로 행동했다고 결론 지었다. 그는 오늘날의 적법한 과정에 대한 이해와 표준에 의해 경계를 판단하는 것이 문제가된다고 주장한다. 2004 년, 기자이자 역사가 인 프레 더릭 앨런 (Frederick Allen)은 몬태나의 경계 역사 (1864–1870)에 대한 최신 균형 잡힌 설명으로 검토 된 \"괜찮고 질서 정연한 린칭 : 몬태나 경계\"를 발표했다. Allen의 저서는 Alder Gulch에서 가장 초기 경계의 동기와 방법을 강화하면서 1860 년대 후반에 경계주의에 대한 경멸에 대해 언급했습니다. Merrill G. Burlingame의 \"The Montana Frontier\"(1942)와 Michael P. Malone의 \"Montana-A History of 2 Centeries\"(1991)와 같은 몬태나 역사에 대한 더 많은 일반 주의자는 Dimsdale, Langford 및 Biedler의 초기 기록을 기반으로 한 경계 기간을 적절히 요약합니다. 또한 소설가이자 몬태나 역사가 Dan Cushman의 \"Montana : The Gold Frontier\"(1973)와 같은 몬태나의 많은 주제 역사는 경계 시대를 다룹니다.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was the Montana Vigilantes formed?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The Montana Vigilantes were formed in 1863, when the mining camps of what was then eastern Idaho Territory lacked effective legal authority ["}

He also worked on methods of detecting submarines during World War I. He applied for the first patent on a seismic exploration method in 1914, which was issued in 1917. Due to the war, he was unable to follow up on the idea. John Clarence Karcher discovered seismic reflections independently while working for the United States Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) on methods of sound ranging to detect artillery. In discussion with colleagues, the idea developed that these reflections could aid in exploration for petroleum.

Legend claims that Rugby football was started around the time of 1845 in Rugby School, Rugby, Warwickshire, England, although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times. Rugby eventually split into two sports in 1895 when twenty one clubs split from the original Rugby Football Union, to form the Northern Union (later to be named rugby league in 1922) in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, Northern England over the issue of payment to players, thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay its players, rugby union turned fully professional in 1995. Both sports are run by their respective world governing bodies World Rugby (rugby union) and the Rugby League International Federation (rugby league). Rugby football was one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports.

XETV management later stated that it had decided to maintain its analog signal to benefit Mexican viewers. XETV's analog signal was eventually repurposed on 5 March 2012, when the station began multicasting on its digital signal with the addition of Televisa's youth-oriented Canal 5 network on subchannel 6.2 and on its analog feed, while digital channel 6.1 retained the newscasts, CW network and syndicated programs in English. On the same date, XHBJ-TV channel 45 dropped Canal 5 for Galavisión. Canal 5 replaced XETV's English-language programming on its analog signal, in order to serve Spanish-speaking viewers in Tijuana that did not have television sets with built-in digital tuners or digital converter boxes prior to the Tijuana market's 2013 transition to digital television. The affiliation switch coincided with the commencement of digital multicasting on Televisa's Tijuana stations. Canal 5 moved to its primary channel on 31 May 2017, at which point, the 6.2 subchannel was decommissioned.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: XETV-TDT\nContent: XETV-TDT는 멕시코 정부에 의해 티후아나에게 라이센스를 부여하기 때문에 FCC의 규칙에 따라 다루지 않습니다. 이는 텔레비전 방송국 이이 조항에 따라 수행되도록 요청하더라도 로컬 케이블 제공 업체가 XETV-TDT를 운반 할 필요가 없음을 의미합니다. 영어 통화 XETV는 COX Communications, Time Warner Cable (현재 전세 스펙트럼) 및 AT & T U-Verse, KFMB-TV의 \"The CW San Diego\"는 미국 케이블 시스템의 XETV와 Satell Television Providers DirectV 및 Dish Network에서 XETV를 대체했습니다.
