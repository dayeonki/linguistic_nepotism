The triple Xs were back on the company logo and were used on almost all of Pearl's advertisements. The Xs held this significant role to the end of production at the brewery in 2001, when the brewery closed its doors and the company logo was abandoned. As production of Pearl and Pearl Light spun up at Miller's Fort Worth facility, the product logos were redesigned.

However, Pearl's Country Club malt liquor still displays the XXXs in its logo.\nMany people wonder where the Xs came from, and how were they ever used on beer. In truth, the three Xs are actually a quality rating system. The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century. As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party. The courier's job was to sample beer at inns along the way. If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn's sign or door with a single X. If the inn's beer was deemed good, the sign or door would receive two Xs.

There are many axioms in the production of dentures that must be understood; ignorance of one axiom can lead to failure of the denture. In the vast majority of cases, complete dentures should be comfortable soon after insertion, although almost always at least two adjustment visits are necessary to remove the cause of sore spots. One of the most critical aspects of dentures is that the impression of the denture must be perfectly made and used with perfect technique to make an accurate model of the patient's edentulous (toothless) gums. The dentist or denturist must use a process called border molding to ensure that the denture flanges are properly extended. An array of problems may occur if the final impression of the denture is not made properly. It takes considerable patience and experience for a dentist to know how to make a denture, and for this reason it may be in the patient's best interest to seek a specialist, either a prosthodontist or denturist, to make the denture. A denturist is a trained and licensed professional who sees patients in need of dentures, partials, relines or repairs. A denturist not only takes the impression, but makes the entire denture in his or her own laboratory. The denturist then schedules a date for the delivery of the finished dentures to the patient. A general dentist may do a good job making dentures, but only if he or she is meticulous and experienced. Many dentists no longer make dentures themselves. but instead take an impression of the patients' mouth and then either send the impressions to a dental laboratory, which could be anywhere in the world, or send the patient to a denturist. Once the laboratory receives dental impressions of the patient's mouth, the laboratory creates plaster molds from them. The laboratory uses the molds to create the wax rims used to register the patient's bite. These wax rims are returned to the dentist, who uses them to register the patient's bite. The dentist may assist the patient in choosing the correct size of teeth for the dentures, or simply make the selection himself. Once bite registration is completed and the teeth are selected for the dentures, the wax rim is usually returned to the dental laboratory in order to have the denture teeth set into the wax. Once the teeth are set into the wax rim, the result is a prefinished denture that looks almost like the finished product. This prefinished denture is usually returned to the dentist's office and the patient usually has a chance to approve the setup (for immediate or standard dentures) or to try the denture before it is finished. After approval by the patient, the dentist returns the pre-denture to the laboratory for final processing. The finished denture is then returned to the dentist's office for delivery to the patient.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 义齿清洁剂\nContent: 义齿清洁剂（也称为牙齿清洁剂）是一种清洁剂，用于清洁牙齿的牙齿。它们的主要用途是控制微生物在义齿上的生长，尤其是“白色念珠菌”，从而防止牙齿相关的口腔炎。当牙齿戴在口腔中时，生物膜会形成可能与牙菌斑相似。它可能变硬并矿化为牙周积极。义齿清洁剂还用于清除饮食，烟草使用，喝咖啡，喝茶等可能引起的污渍和其他碎屑。\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is a denture specialist called?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: A specialist who focuses on the design, fabrication, and fitting of complete or partial dentures is commonly called a prosthodontist or, in jurisdictions where they are licensed, a denturist; both professionals possess advanced training specifically aimed at producing comfortable, functional dentures and managing related oral-rehabilitation issues ["}

Specialty drugs are often biologics—\"drugs derived from living cells\" that are injectable or infused (although some are oral medications). They are used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, H.I.V. psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and hepatitis C. In 1990 there were 10 specialty drugs on the market, in the mid-1990s there were fewer than 30, by 2008 there were 200, and by 2015 there were 300. Drugs are often defined as specialty because their price is much higher than that of non-specialty drugs. Medicare defines any drug for which the negotiated price is $670 per month or more, as a specialty drug which is placed in a specialty tier that requires a higher patient cost sharing. Drugs are also identified as specialty when there is a special handling requirement or the drug is only available via a limited distributions network. By 2015 \"specialty medications accounted for one-third of all spending on drugs in the United States, up from 19 percent in 2004 and heading toward 50 percent in the next 10 years\", according to IMS Health, which tracks prescriptions. According to a 2010 article in Forbes, specialty drugs for rare diseases became more expensive \"than anyone imagined\" and their success came \"at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses\" was \"in decline\". In 2015 analysis by \"The Wall Street Journal\" suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 美国的特种药物\nContent: 2007年9月27日，乔治·W·布什（George W. 5个标准的组合：药物指南，沟通计划，确保安全使用的元素，实施系统和提交评估的时间表。\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What year were specialty drugs designated?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The provided document does not name a specific calendar year in which the term “specialty drug” was formally designated; it states only that specialty drugs represent “a recent designation of pharmaceuticals” characterized by high cost, complexity, or required patient support ["}

Māori descend from a race of Polynesian sea-wanderers who, moved from East Asia and south-east Asia to the islands of the Pacific. Tradition tells of their further journeyings from Hawaiki to New Zealand, and some commentators have identified this homeland as Havai'i, an island in the Society Group. Overpopulation, scarcity of food and civil war forced many of them to migrate once more, and New Zealand became their new home. Māori settled New Zealand between AD 1280–1320. They quickly learnt to hunt the numerous species of moa and seals in New Zealand and settled across the North and South islands in less than a few decades. There is a change in the pollen record from inland Otago from 600 years ago from a forest to bracken flora. It has been inferred that this relates to fires being lit during Maori exploration.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 新西兰历史\nContent: 新西兰的历史至少可以追溯到700年来，到了波利尼西亚人发现和定居时，他开发了一种以亲属关系和土地为中心的毛利人文化。 1642年12月13日，新西兰的第一位欧洲探险家是荷兰航海家亚伯·塔斯曼（Abel Tasman）。荷兰人也是第一个探索和绘制新西兰海岸线的非本地人。詹姆斯·库克（James Cook）上尉于1769年10月在他的三场航行中的第一次到达新西兰，他是第一个绕行和绘制新西兰的欧洲探险家。从18世纪后期开始，该国经常被探险家和其他水手，传教士，商人和冒险家拜访。 1840年，《威塔吉条约》（Waitangi）在英国王冠和各种毛利人酋长之间签署，将新西兰带入大英帝国，并赋予毛利人与英国臣民相同的权利。在整个世纪的剩余时间里，都有广泛的英国定居点，到了下一个世纪初。战争和实施欧洲经济和法律制度导致新西兰的大部分土地从毛利人传给帕凯哈（欧洲）所有权，随后大多数毛利人随后变得贫穷。\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was New Zealand first settled?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Archaeological and traditional evidence indicate that the first human settlement of New Zealand occurred when Polynesian ancestors of the Māori arrived between AD 1280 and 1320, marking the beginning of continuous habitation in the islands ["}

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory.

One proposed explanation for this dearth of cloud features is that Uranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low internal thermal flux. Why Uranus's heat flux is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun. Uranus, by contrast, radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere. In fact, Uranus's heat flux is only  W/m², which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 0.075 W/m². The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49 K (−224 °C), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System, colder than Neptune.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 天王星\nContent: 天王星的内部热量显着低于其他巨型行星。从天文学的角度来看，它的热通量较低。为什么天王星的内部温度如此之低，仍然尚不清楚。海王星是天王星的大小和成分接近双胞胎，辐射到太空中的2.61倍的能量是从太阳带入太空的2.61倍，但天王星几乎根本不会散发出任何多余的热量。天王星在频谱的远红外（即热）部分中辐射的总功率是在其大气中吸收的太阳能。天王星的热通量仅是大约地球的内部热通量。天王星对流层面中记录的最低温度是使天王星成为太阳系中最冷的行星。\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is the temperature of Uranus?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The coldest measured temperature in Uranus’s atmosphere occurs at its tropopause, where it drops to about 49 K (−224 °C), making Uranus the coldest known planet in the Solar System ["}

Biedler是Alder Gulch和Helena Vigilante Enforcers之一，他在他的个人期刊上写了他的警惕活动。他们直到他去世后才能获得，威尔伯·桑德斯（Wilbur Sanders）的daughter妇海伦·桑德斯（Helen F. Sanders）终于于1957年出版。落基山脉的途径在1893年回到明尼苏达州的家后。西方历史学家在1912年对蒙大拿州历史学会的讲话中，奥林·惠勒（Olin Wheeler）在对纳撒尼尔·兰福德（Nathaniel Langford）一生的敬意中就alder gulch守夜者发表了积极评论。直到1982年才出版的另一个说法是前蒙大拿州最高法院大法官（1922-1935）Lew L. Callaway。由他的儿子Lew Callaway Jr.编辑，“蒙大拿州的正义吊犬：行动中的警惕性”源于卡拉威（Callaway）在1800年代后期与维利兰特队长詹姆斯·威廉（James William）的联系。 Lew Callaway广泛写了有关警惕者及其故事的文章，这些故事增加了有关在本卷中如何捕获警惕者如何捕获警惕性的详细细节。尽管在此期间的一些警惕活动受到公民和公民领袖的批评，但人们对他们在不断增长的领土上对法律和秩序的贡献有所普遍肯定。标记 C.狄龙（C. Dillon）的“蒙大拿州警惕者1863-1870金，枪支和绞刑架”（2013年）得出结论，鉴于当时奥尔德·戈尔奇（Alder Gulch）和海伦娜（Helena）在阿尔德·戈尔奇（Alder Gulch）和海伦娜（Helena）的无法环境和犯罪活动中，缺乏正常运作的司法系统，以及当时对正当程序的理解，当时的警惕性在他们认为的方式上最适合他们的社区。他认为，根据当今的理解和适当程序的标准来判断警惕性是有问题的。 2004年，记者和历史学家弗雷德里克·艾伦（Frederick Allen）出版了“一个体面而有序的私刑：蒙大拿州警惕者”，被评论为对蒙大拿州维吉兰特历史（1864-1870）的最新平衡帐户。艾伦（Allen）的书增强了奥尔德·峡谷（Alder Gulch）最早的警惕性的动机和方法，同时评论了1860年代后期对警惕性的不屑一顾。诸如美林（Merrill G.

This is how the vertebrae are counted: 24 separate vertebrae and the sacrum, formed from 5 fused vertebrae and the coccyx, formed from 3-5 fused vertebrae. If you count the coccyx and sacrum each as one vertebra, then there are 26 vertebrae. If the fused vertebrae are all counted separately, then the total number of vertebrae comes to between 32 and 34.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 猫解剖学\nContent: Cats have seven cervical vertebrae like almost all mammals, thirteen thoracic vertebrae (humans have twelve), seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five), three sacral vertebrae (humans have five because of their bipedal posture), and, except for Manx cats and other shorter tailed cats, twenty-two or twenty-three caudal vertebrae (humans have three to五，融合到内部尾骨中）。与人相比，额外的腰椎和胸椎说明了猫的增强脊髓迁移率和柔韧性。尾椎骨形成“尾巴”，猫在快速运动过程中用作对身体的平衡。在他们的椎骨之间，它们具有弹性盘，可用于缓冲跳跃降落。\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How many vertebrae does a human have?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: In adults, the human vertebral column contains 24 separate (movable) vertebrae—7 cervical, 12 thoracic, and 5 lumbar—plus two composite bones: the sacrum (formed from five fused vertebrae) and the coccyx (formed from three to five fused vertebrae), giving a total of 26 distinct bones; if every fused segment of the sacrum and coccyx is counted individually, the original number rises to 32–34, which equals the 33 separate vertebrae present at birth before normal fusion occurs ["}

He also worked on methods of detecting submarines during World War I. He applied for the first patent on a seismic exploration method in 1914, which was issued in 1917. Due to the war, he was unable to follow up on the idea. John Clarence Karcher discovered seismic reflections independently while working for the United States Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) on methods of sound ranging to detect artillery. In discussion with colleagues, the idea developed that these reflections could aid in exploration for petroleum. With several others, many affiliated with the University of Oklahoma, Karcher helped to form the Geological Engineering Company, incorporated in Oklahoma in April, 1920.

Rugby eventually split into two sports in 1895 when twenty one clubs split from the original Rugby Football Union, to form the Northern Union (later to be named rugby league in 1922) in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, Northern England over the issue of payment to players, thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay its players, rugby union turned fully professional in 1995. Both sports are run by their respective world governing bodies World Rugby (rugby union) and the Rugby League International Federation (rugby league).

While the U.S. switchover deadline of 17 February was later pushed back to 12 June 2009 and only applied to American-licensed stations in any case, plans were announced to voluntarily make the station's English-language programming digital-only. The analog signal would be repurposed to retransmit the Mexican Galavisión network (not to be confused with the American cable channel of the same name). Claims on XETV's website that the station was indeed going to transmit a digitally-exclusive signal were rescinded on 17 February 2009 as the station decided to delay cutting off its analog signal until after it secured approval from the Mexican government. XETV management later stated that it had decided to maintain its analog signal to benefit Mexican viewers. XETV's analog signal was eventually repurposed on 5 March 2012, when the station began multicasting on its digital signal with the addition of Televisa's youth-oriented Canal 5 network on subchannel 6.2 and on its analog feed, while digital channel 6.1 retained the newscasts, CW network and syndicated programs in English. On the same date, XHBJ-TV channel 45 dropped Canal 5 for Galavisión. Canal 5 replaced XETV's English-language programming on its analog signal, in order to serve Spanish-speaking viewers in Tijuana that did not have television sets with built-in digital tuners or digital converter boxes prior to the Tijuana market's 2013 transition to digital television. The affiliation switch coincided with the commencement of digital multicasting on Televisa's Tijuana stations. Canal 5 moved to its primary channel on 31 May 2017, at which point, the 6.2 subchannel was decommissioned.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: XETV-TDT\nContent: 由于墨西哥政府已将XETV-TDT授予蒂华纳，因此FCC的必须携带规则不涵盖。这意味着，即使电视台请求根据此规定携带，也不需要本地有线提供商携带XETV-TDT。作为英语电台XETV是由Cox Communications，Time Warner Cable（现为宪章频谱）和圣地亚哥的AT＆T U-verse携带的，所有这些都在第6频道的第6频道上。KFMB-TV的“ CW San Diego”取代了美国电缆系统上的XETV，以及卫星电视台Directer directer directv and DiseNewert。 XETV由所有墨西哥电缆系统在其覆盖范围内携带，因为联邦电信研究所（IFT）要求当地广播电台的运输。\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Does XETV-TDT have a website?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Yes, XETV-TDT does have an official website; this is evidenced by the fact that “claims on XETV's website that the station was indeed going to transmit a digitally-exclusive signal were rescinded on 17 February 2009,” proving that the station maintained an online presence to publish and later retract such information ["}

However, efforts to rebuild the carrier force were unsuccessful since the training given to new aviators was of a very low standard. Consequently, the new carriers never went to sea with a full air group. This left the Japanese with a ragtag collection of carriers, led by the \"Zuikaku\", which was the sole survivor of the Pearl Harbor attack force. The Japanese were left with two choices, either to commit their remaining strength in an all-out offensive, or to sit by while the Americans occupied the Philippines and cut the sea lanes between Japan and vital resources from the Dutch East Indies and Malaya. The plan devised by the Japanese was a final attempt to create a decisive battle by utilizing their last remaining strength, the firepower of its heavy cruisers and battleships, which were to be all committed against the American beachhead at Leyte.

The series is produced by Proper Television, whose president, Guy O'Sullivan, was the director of the original \"Britain's Worst Driver\" series until its cancellation in 2003. O'Sullivan served as executive producer of \"Canada's Worst Driver\" until his death in April 2017, doubling as executive producer of sister series \"Canada's Worst Handyman\" until its cancellation in 2011. As such, \"Canada's Worst Driver\" is considered to be the production company's flagship show and, with 14 seasons aired as of December 2018, the longest-running of any \"Worst\" series to date. Unlike other \"Worst\" series around the world, where being a graduate is rewarded with a new car while the Worst Driver has their car destroyed, \"Canada's Worst Driver\" emphasizes the learning process of the contestants and the science of driving and is often more serious than any other \"Worst Driver\" version around the world, awarding no prizes aside from a trophy at the end of each season for being named the worst (with the exception of season twelve, in which, despite ultimately being named the worst, Krystal McCann wasn't even worthy of being awarded the trophy, leading to Tyler Dupont becoming the first-ever nominee to be awarded the \"Final Graduate\" trophy), as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain, as other versions are mainly comedic. The series is also aired dubbed in French in Canada as \"Les Pires Chauffards Canadiens\" on the Z channel. Until 2011, when \"Canada's Worst Handyman\" was cancelled and later replaced in 2015 with \"Blood, Sweat & Tools,\" \"Canada's Worst Driver\" and \"Canada's Worst Handyman\" were the two highest-rated programs on Discovery Channel Canada.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 加拿大最糟糕的驾驶员12\nContent: 泰勒在与专家的最后一次会面中自信地宣称自己不是加拿大最糟糕的车手，而丹尼拉（Daniella）承认，尽管作为驾驶员有所进步，但她仍然感到太紧张，无法在高速公路上开车。同时，克里斯塔尔（Krystal）仍然反抗直到最后。最终，专家们同意，无需讨论谁是决赛中最糟糕的人。尽管泰勒在最后一场比赛中犯了一些重大错误，而丹尼拉（Daniella）的往绩不佳，以及她在高速公路上的危险优柔寡断，可能导致她被评为许多前几个赛季中最糟糕的事情，但克里斯塔尔（Krystal）显然是对她的敌意和拒绝学习的最糟糕的同意。然而，安德鲁确实感到失望，他们无法正确地触及克里斯塔尔，并认为本赛季他们失败了。然而，卡姆告诉他不要那样的感觉，提醒他和其他专家，还有像克里斯塔尔这样的其他人（暗示了“加拿大最差的驾驶员2”的科林·谢泼德（Colin Sheppard）和“加拿大最差的驾驶员6”的斯科特·舒林克（Scott Schurink）的机会，他们有机会做出改变，但从未做出足够的认真对待。\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How many seasons does Canada's Worst Driver have?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Canada's Worst Driver has aired 14 seasons as of December 2018, making it the longest-running series in the international “Worst Driver” franchise ["}
