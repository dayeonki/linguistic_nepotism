This was followed by Johns's best-known book, \"Flowers of the Field\", published in two volumes in 1851 with over 200 uncredited illustrations by Stackhouse. Referred to as \"the bible of the amateur botanist,\" its success was such that it went into more than 50 editions and was still in print a century after it first came out.

The partition took place on 16 October 1905 and separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas. The former province of Bengal was divided into two new provinces \"Bengal\" (comprising western Bengal as well as the province of Bihar and Orissa) and Eastern Bengal and Assam with Dacca as the capital of the latter. Partition was promoted for administrative reasons: Bengal was geographically as large as France and had a significantly larger population. Curzon stated the eastern region was neglected and under-governed. By splitting the province, an improved administration could be established in the east, where subsequently, the population would benefit from new schools and employment opportunities. The Hindus of West Bengal who dominated Bengal's business and rural life complained that the division would make them a minority in a province that would incorporate the province of Bihar and Orissa. Indians were outraged at what they recognised as a \"divide and rule\" policy.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How large is Bengal by area?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Bengal spans a total area of about 232,752 square kilometres, a territory that collectively includes the Indian state of West Bengal and the independent nation of Bangladesh ["}

Saturday & Sunday masses were held at Bishop Connolly High School. When the ruins were searched it was found that very little remained from the fire. One stained-glass window, \"The Flight into Egypt\", was spared destruction due to being in Connecticut for repair. The third Notre Dame was designed and built around this window. The three Angels that had adorned the Sanctuary Lamp and two candlesticks, though in the middle of the blaze, managed to survive the inferno. These too are part of the new church. The Sacred Heart Monument also miraculously survived the blaze even though it was in close proximity to the church. It wasn't until 1986 that the new church was built and ready for use. The orientation of the new building is reverse what the old one was. The new churches \"front\" sits in the footprint of the old churches \"rear\". In 2012, it was revealed that the parish of Notre Dame de Lourdes would be merging with the parish of Immaculate Conception in Fall River. This occurred in June 2012 and they will be using Notre Dame as their church, taking on the name St. Bernadette.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What denomination is St. Joseph's Church in Fall River?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Joseph’s Church in Fall River—including its location, construction date, architectural style, designer, and listing on the National Register of Historic Places—does not state the church’s religious denomination ["}

Hamilton recognized that a large sector of this range contained distinctive granitic rocks like South Australia's Adelaide orogenic belt. Associated fossils of diverse ages in Antarctica, Australia, and southernmost Africa further linked these continents, and supported then-radical explanations of continental drift. Before traveling to Antarctica, Hamilton was what he later described as a \"closet drifter,\" aware that Southern Hemisphere geology provided powerful evidence favoring continental drift. He returned to Antarctica for fieldwork in 1963 and 1964 in other parts of the Transantarctic Mountains, including those once continuous with other Australian tracts. He also investigated in the field evidence for drift in Australia and South Africa, integrating his work with that of other researchers to show how Antarctica and other Gondwana continents had drifted apart.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How large is Antarctica?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Antarctica covers roughly 14 million km² (about 5.4 million mi²), making it the fifth-largest continent and approximately 1.3 times the size of Europe ["}

He was a frail child, nearly dying of pneumonia in his early years and missing a whole year of school as a result. In his early years Chamberlain was not interested in basketball, because he thought it was \"a game for sissies\". Instead, he was an avid track and field athlete: as a youth, he high jumped 6 feet, 6 inches, ran the 440 yards in 49.0 seconds and the 880 yards in 1:58.3, put the shot 53 feet, 4 inches, and broad jumped 22 feet. But according to Chamberlain, \"basketball was king in Philadelphia\", so he eventually turned to the sport. Because Chamberlain was a very tall child, already measuring at age 10 and when he entered Philadelphia's Overbrook High School, he had a natural advantage against his peers; he soon was renowned for his scoring talent, his physical strength and his shot blocking abilities. According to ESPN journalist Hal Bock, Chamberlain was \"scary, flat-out frightening... before he came along, most basketball players were mortal-sized men. Chamberlain changed that.\" It was also in this period of his life when his three lifelong nicknames \"Wilt the Stilt\", \"Goliath\", and his favorite, \"The Big Dipper\", were allegedly born.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When did Wilton Norman Chamberlain die?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Wilton Norman Chamberlain died on October 12, 1999 ["}

Panagoulis ignited a bomb at a point of the coastal road where the limousine carrying Papadopoulos would have to slow down, but the bomb failed to harm Papadopoulos. Panagoulis was captured a few hours later in a nearby sea cave, since the boat sent to help him escape was instructed to leave at a specific time and he couldn't swim there on time due to strong sea currents. After his arrest, he was taken to the Greek Military Police (EAT-ESA) offices where he was questioned, beaten and tortured. On 17 November 1968, Panagoulis was sentenced to death but was personally pardoned by Papadopoulos, served only five years in prison, and after democracy was restored was elected a member of Parliament.

A clay tablet shows that the Babylonians knew of Pythagorean triples 1200 years before Pythagoras, but nobody knows if they knew the more-general Pythagorean theorem. The Chinese proof uses four similar triangles to prove the theorem.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was the Pythagorean theorem developed?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The exact moment the Pythagorean theorem was developed is uncertain, but evidence shows it was already “well-known to the mathematicians of the Old Babylonian period,” roughly between the 20th and 16th centuries BC, more than a millennium before Pythagoras’s birth ["}

They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of the cubs varies – sometimes a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.\nWeaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest. When one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. Females often fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the male. Cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. Up to 80% of lion cubs will die before the age of two.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Why do lions kill their own cubs?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Male–lion infanticide occurs chiefly when a new dominant male or coalition takes over a pride; by killing nursing cubs that are not his, he removes future rivals and, crucially, causes the mothers to stop lactating and return to estrus sooner, giving him an earlier chance to mate and pass on his own genes, so the behavior is favored by natural selection and persists in the population ["}

Nerf wars can be a wide range of games, from informal shootouts in offices and basements to well-organized outdoor battles with high-powered modified blasters. Since foam-firing guns are relatively safe and cheap, Nerf wars can include participants and battlefields otherwise unsuitable for airsoft and paintball.\nNerf wars can take place anywhere. Any area with a good balance of open space and cover can be a candidate. Basements, offices, and backyards are common locations for informal games. For larger wars with more participants, bigger venues like gymnasiums, public parks, forests, ravines, and schools make good playing areas. The inside of a large hall such as a room can may be turned into a battlefield by turning tables onto their sides.

Nerf wars can be a wide range of games, from informal shootouts in offices and basements to well-organized outdoor battles with high-powered modified blasters. Since foam-firing guns are relatively safe and cheap, Nerf wars can include participants and battlefields otherwise unsuitable for airsoft and paintball.\nNerf wars can take place anywhere. Any area with a good balance of open space and cover can be a candidate. Basements, offices, and backyards are common locations for informal games. For larger wars with more participants, bigger venues like gymnasiums, public parks, forests, ravines, and schools make good playing areas. The inside of a large hall such as a room can may be turned into a battlefield by turning tables onto their sides.

Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various Māori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving Māori the same rights as British subjects.

The publication of the work coincided with Swift's striking out on his own, having despaired of getting a good \"living\" from Temple or Temple's influence. There is speculation about what caused the rift between Swift and his employer, but, as A. C. Elias persuasively argues, it seems that the final straw came with Swift's work on Temple's \"Letters.\" Swift had been engaged to translate Temple's French correspondence, but Temple, or someone close to Temple, edited the French text to make Temple seem both prescient and more fluent. Consequently, the letters and the translations Swift provided did not gibe, and, since Swift could not accuse Temple of falsifying his letters, and because the public would never believe that the retired state minister had lied, Swift came across as incompetent.\nEven though Swift published the \"Tale\" as he left Temple's service, it was conceived earlier, and the book is a salvo in one of Temple's battles. Swift's general polemic concerns an argument (the \"Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns\") that had been over for nearly ten years by the time the book was published. The \"Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns\" was a French academic debate of the early 1690s, occasioned by Fontenelle arguing that modern scholarship had allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge. Temple argued against this position in his \"On Ancient and Modern Learning\" (where he provided the first English formulation of the commonplace that modern critics see more only because they are dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants), and Temple's somewhat naive essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were Richard Bentley (classicist and editor) and William Wotton (critic).\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Where was Jonathan Swift born?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, on 30 November 1667 ["}

In this sense there are many human 'races.' But this is not the sense in which many anthropologists, race-classifiers, and racists have used the term.\" He admits that in a biological sense, there is the existence of races within mankind. However, he also believes that not all of mankind can be classified. Part of his reasoning has to do with mixed origin, which has resulted in “overlapping” of physicalities. Instead of races and subspecies, he prefers mixed ethnic groups. His writing further emphasizes the complexity of our descent and rejects claims that support one race being superior when compared to others. He also says profoundly that the \"so-called\" main divisions of mankind are species instead of races.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Which race has the most people?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The race (ethnic group) with the greatest number of people is the Han Chinese, recognized as the world’s largest ethnic group; their predominant tongue, Mandarin, is likewise the most spoken native language globally ["}

Initially, he determined there should be a community of Benedictine monks at the new cathedral, performing the liturgies and singing the daily Office. This caused great resentment amongst the secular clergy of the diocese, who felt they were being snubbed. In the end, negotiations with both the English Benedictines and the community of French Benedictines at Farnborough failed and a 'traditional' choir of men and boys was set up instead. Despite great financial problems, the Choir School opened on 5 October 1901 with eleven boy choristers, in the building originally intended for the Benedictine monks. Cardinal Vaughan received the boys with the words \"You are the foundation stones\". The Cathedral Choir was officially instituted three months later in January 1902. Sung Masses and Offices were immediately established when the cathedral opened for worship in 1903, and have continued without interruption ever since. Today, Westminster Cathedral Choir is the only professional Catholic choir in the world to sing daily Mass and Vespers.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who designed Westminster Cathedral?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Westminster Cathedral was designed by the English architect John Francis Bentley, who is also credited with designing the building of Sacred Heart High School in Hammersmith ["}

However, the recovery of water-soluble compounds usually decreases rapidly if the molecular weight of the analyte exceeds 25% of the membrane’s molecular weight cutoff.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is the molecular weight of water?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The molecular weight of ordinary water, expressed as its molar mass based on the natural isotopic distribution of hydrogen and oxygen, is 18.0153 g mol⁻¹; on a molecule-by-molecule basis, the mass can range from 18.010 564 6863 u for H₂¹⁶O to 22.027 7364 u for fully deuterated D₂¹⁶O, reflecting differences in isotopic composition ["}

The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T-cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who first identified the cell?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Robert Hooke is credited as the first person to identify and describe cells, a discovery he made in the 17th century after improvements in microscope technology allowed him to observe the microscopic structure of cork and coin the term “cell” for the box-like structures he saw ["}

While traveling under the aegis of the Curtis Institute, he briefly played a loaned Stradivarius, which was exchanged for a Januarius Gagliano. In 1929 Temianka owned the violin made in 1752 by Joannes Baptista Guadagnini. In the 1930s he played a Silvestre violin, with which he made his early Vintage recordings, and subsequently a Januarius Gagliano and a Carlo Bergonzi.\nThe Stradivarius he played during the years of the Paganini Quartet was the \"Comte Cozio di Salabue\" of 1727, which was Paganini's own concert violin. It was later played by Martin Beaver, first violinist of the Tokyo String Quartet, which played since 1995 on the same quartet of Stradivarius instruments once owned by Paganini, until the Tokyo String Quartet retired in July 2013. These remarkable instruments—the viola had inspired Paganini to commission Hector Berlioz's \"Harold en Italie\"—were also played by the Cleveland Quartet for almost 15 years, beginning in 1982, and are presently owned by Nippon Music Foundation of Japan, after deacquisition by the Corcoran Gallery in the mid-1990s for $15 million. They were then played for several years by the Hagen Quartet, and are now in the hands of the Quartetto di Cremona.\nWhen the years of the Paganini Quartet came to an end, Temianka played a Michelangelo Bergonzi of 1759. His recordings of the Handel Sonatas were made on an Andrea Guarneri of 1687.In February 2013, Chapman University endowed the Henri Temianka Professorship in Music and Scholarship in String Studies. The violin played by Albert Saparoff, concertmaster of the Hollywood Symphony, was endowed as the Temianka-Saparoff violin, and is dedicated for the use of a selected recipient while studying there.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When were stradivarius violins made?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Stradivarius violins were crafted by the Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari mainly between about 1660 and his death in 1737, with the most coveted examples dating from his “golden period” of approximately 1700–1720; for example, the Stradivarius once owned by Paavo Berglund was built around 1700 ["}

Major Jewish fortunes were made in London, Oxford, Lincoln, Bristol, and Norwich. The Crown, in turn, capitalized on the prosperity of its Jews. In addition to many arbitrary taxes, Richard I established the Ordinance of the Jewry in 1194 in an attempt to organize the Jewish community. It ensured that mandatory records would be kept by royal officials for all Jewish transactions. Every debt was recorded on a chirography to allow the king immediate and complete access to Jewish property. Richard also established a special exchequer to collect any unpaid debts due after the death of a Jewish creditor. The establishment of the Exchequer of the Jews eventually made all transactions of the English Jewry liable to taxation by the king in addition to the 10% of all sums recovered by Jews with the help of English courts. So, while the First and Second Crusades increased anti-Jewish sentiments, Jews in England went relatively unscathed beyond occasional fines and special levies.

In the parody film \"Thumb Wars\", the role of Leia was filled by a character named Princess Bunhead, who has two cinnamon rolls for hair. In 2015, Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd's character in the horror-comedy TV series \"Scream Queens\", a rich and disaffected sorority girl known as Chanel No. 3, wears earmuffs in every scene as an homage to Fisher's iconic Leia hairstyle.

Dimsdale was a member of the Alder Gulch Vigilance Committee and editor of the \"Montana Post.\" His early accounts of the Alder Gulch vigilante events are widely cited and the book version of his articles, the first book published in Montana Territory in 1866, has been extensively reprinted since its first edition.\nX. Biedler, one of the Alder Gulch and Helena vigilante enforcers wrote about his vigilante activities in his personal journals. They weren't available until well after his death when Helen F. Sanders, the daughter-in-law of Wilbur Sanders finally got them published in 1957. Nathaniel Langford, also a member of the vigilantes, explorer of the upper Yellowstone (1870), first superintendent of Yellowstone National Park (1872–1877), territorial tax collector (1864–1869) and author published \"Vigilante Days and Ways-Pioneers of the Rockies\" in 1893 after he returned to his home in Minnesota. In a 1912 speech to the Montana Historical Society, western historian, Olin Wheeler provided positive commentary on the Alder Gulch vigilantes in a tribute to the life of Nathaniel Langford.\nAnother account, not published until 1982, is that of former Montana Supreme Court Justice (1922–1935) Lew L. Callaway. Edited by his son Lew Callaway Jr., \"Montana's Righteous Hangmen:The Vigilantes in Action\" stems from Callaway's association with vigilante Captain James William in the late 1800s. Lew Callaway wrote extensively about the vigilantes and his stories which add more intimate details about how the vigilantes operated are captured in this volume. Although some vigilante activities during this period were criticized by citizens and civic leaders, there was a general affirmation of their purpose and contribution to law and order in a growing territory. Mark C. Dillon's \"Montana Vigilantes 1863–1870 Gold, Guns and Gallows\" (2013) concludes that given the lawless environment and criminal activity in Alder Gulch and Helena at the time, the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time, the vigilantes acted in a way they thought was best for their communities. He contends that judging the vigilantes by today's understanding and standards of due process is problematic.\nIn 2004, Frederick Allen, a journalist and historian, published \"A Decent and Orderly Lynching:The Montana Vigilantes\" reviewed as an up-to-day balanced account of Montana's vigilante history (1864–1870). Allen's book reinforces the motivations and methods of the earliest vigilantes in Alder Gulch while commenting on the growing disdain for vigilantism in the late 1860s. More generalist works on Montana history such as Merrill G. Burlingame's \"The Montana Frontier\" (1942) and Michael P. Malone's \"Montana-A History of Two Centuries\" (1991) adequately summarize the vigilante period largely based on earlier accounts by Dimsdale, Langford and Biedler. Additionally, many topical histories of Montana, such as novelist and Montana historian Dan Cushman's \"Montana: The Gold Frontier\" (1973) cover the vigilante period.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was the Montana Vigilantes formed?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The Montana Vigilantes were formed in 1863, when the mining camps of what was then eastern Idaho Territory lacked effective legal authority ["}

Major security software vendors (including Microsoft itself) planned to continue offering support and definitions for Windows XP past the end of support to varying extents, along with the developers of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera web browsers; despite these measures, critics similarly argued that users should eventually migrate from XP to a supported platform. The United States' Computer Emergency Readiness Team released an alert in March 2014 advising users of the impending end of support, and informing them that using XP after April 8 may prevent them from meeting US government information security requirements.\nMicrosoft continued to provide Security Essentials virus definitions and updates for its Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) for XP until July 14, 2015. As the end of extended support approached, Microsoft began to increasingly urge XP customers to migrate to newer versions such as Windows 7 or 8 in the interest of security, suggesting that attackers could reverse engineer security patches for newer versions of Windows and use them to target equivalent vulnerabilities in XP.

Massless ropes, point particles, ideal gases and the particle in a box are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, Maxwell's equations and the Schrödinger equation. These laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by molecular orbital models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation.

But this method is limited to polymerization scale and yield. After that, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is developed, which currently is still the most extensively used sequence-regulated method. By employing enzymes, the yields and scales are greatly increased, but the specificity of enzymes towards natural peptides limits this technique to a certain degree. Nowadays, more attention is paid to utilization of ribosomes to directly mimic the transcription and translation process.

Springfield College, of Springfield, Massachusetts, was founded in 1885 as an international training school for YMCA Professionals, while one of the two schools that eventually became Concordia University—Sir George Williams College—started from night courses offered at the Montreal YMCA. Northeastern University began out of a YMCA in Boston, and Franklin University began as the YMCA School of Commerce. San Francisco's Golden Gate University traces its roots to the founding of the YMCA Night School on 1 November 1881. Detroit College of Law, now the Michigan State University College of Law, was founded with a strong connection to the Detroit, Michigan YMCA. It had a 99-year lease on the site, and it was only when it expired that the college moved to East Lansing, Michigan. Youngstown State University traces its roots to the establishment of a law school by the local YMCA in 1908. The Nashville School of Law was the YMCA Night Law School until November 1986, having offered law classes since 1911 and the degree of Juris Doctor since January 1927. YMCA pioneered the concept of night school, providing educational opportunities for people with full-time employment. Many YMCAs offer ESL programmes, alternative high school, day care, and summer camp programs. In India, YMCA University of Science and Technology Faridabad was founded in 1969.

He described the full 2001 IPCC report as \"an admirable description of research activities in climate science\" although he criticized the Summary for Policymakers. Lindzen stated in May 2001 that it did not truly summarize the IPCC report but had been amended to state more definite conclusions. He also emphasized the fact that the summary had not been written by scientists alone.

Despite this mishap, the remainder of Victor Emmanuel II's reign was consumed by wrapping up loose ends and dealing with economic and cultural issues. His role in day-to-day governing gradually dwindled, as it became increasingly apparent that a king could no longer keep a government in office against the will of Parliament.

Universal health insurance was then introduced in Japan (1961), and in Canada through stages, starting with the province of Saskatchewan in 1962, followed by the rest of Canada from 1968 to 1972. The Soviet Union extended universal health care to its rural residents in 1969. Italy introduced its \"Servizio Sanitario Nazionale\" (National Health Service) in 1978.

Every time is measured under one second, from the signal to draw to when the timer is stopped. The current World Fast Draw Association (WFDA) record for Open Class Fast Draw in an event called Standing Balloons is .208 seconds - and that includes the time it takes to react, draw, fire and pop a balloon target at eight feet away. A world class competitor can draw and fire a shot in under half a second. Given that the average human reaction time is around 0.2 to 0.25 seconds, the round is over before most people can react. The reaction times of the best fast draw shooters is 0.145 seconds, which means that the gun is cocked, drawn, aimed (from the hip), and fired in just over 0.06 seconds. To establish a World Fast Draw Association record, a second shot must be fired in the same competition that is no more than 0.30 seconds slower than the first; this is intended to prevent a shot that anticipates the start signal from setting a record.

The method requires a controlled seismic source of energy, such as dynamite or Tovex blast, a specialized air gun or a seismic vibrator, commonly known by the trademark name Vibroseis. Reflection seismology is similar to sonar and echolocation. This article is about surface seismic surveys; for vertical seismic profiles, see VSP.\nReflections and refractions of seismic waves at geologic interfaces within the Earth were first observed on recordings of earthquake-generated seismic waves. The basic model of the Earth's deep interior is based on observations of earthquake-generated seismic waves transmitted through the Earth’s interior (e.g., Mohorovičić, 1910). The use of human-generated seismic waves to map in detail the geology of the upper few kilometers of the Earth's crust followed shortly thereafter and has developed mainly due to commercial enterprise, particularly the petroleum industry.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who first developed reflection seismology?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Fessenden is credited as the first developer of reflection seismology, having conceived the idea of using reflected seismic waves to infer subsurface geology, applied for the initial seismic exploration patent in 1914 (issued 1917), and carried out early research on acoustic‐wave propagation following the Titanic disaster of 1912 and during World War I submarine‐detection work ["}

One of the people believing Red John to be dead is James Panzer, a blogger pretending to devote his life to find a serial killer known as \"the San Joaquin Killer\" (abbreviated SJK, who has killed at least five young women). In reality, Panzer is the killer. Jane suspects Panzer but initially lacks the proof to expose him. When he and Panzer both appear on Karen Cross's television talk show discussing the SJK case, Jane recognizes Panzer has to be stopped and goads Panzer into comparing Red John unfavorably to SJK. Panzer rises to the bait, making bold statements that the SJK killings were the work of a genius and Red John by comparison is a \"\"common sociopath, lazy, sloppy, delusional\"\" and already forgotten since Jane killed him. Panzer then makes the same mistake made by Jane and Kristina Frye: belittling Red John in a public forum. A couple of hours after the television appearance, Panzer is found murdered, with Red John's smiley face painted in blood on one of the walls near his body. Panzer's murder proves Jane's theory that Red John is still alive. This makes Panzer Red John's ninth male victim.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Is John Part still alive?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Yes—John Part is still alive; the document states that he “is a Canadian professional darts player and commentator,” notes his birth date as 29 June 1966, and provides no indication of a date of death, all of which imply he remains living today ["}

France was the second largest tank producer in the world, behind the Soviet Union (see French armoured fighting vehicle production during World War II). Their cavalry tank class filled the role of what are now called MBTs. They also fielded a heavy tank design, and several lighter types for scouting and infantry support. In addition to these types, they were also working on super-heavy breakthrough tanks (FCM F1). The French didn't have an independent Tank Corps. All tanks belonged to either the Infantry or the Cavalry.The Renault FT-17 had a long life and saw use in World War II and even later in Indochina. It was utilised as far away as in China, during the Chinese Civil wars, and versions of the tank were used both against and by the Japanese during the invasion of China. A large number found their way into both Republican and Nationalist hands during the Spanish Civil War. They were used in the Russian Revolution by both the Bolsheviks and the White Russians, and later by the Finns against the Soviets. France exported the FT-17 right up to World War II. The design was also developed by the Italians as the Fiat 3000 and the USSR as the T-18.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is the current French tank?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The current main battle tank in service with the French Army is the Leclerc tank, a modern MBT designed and produced by the French manufacturer GIAT (renamed Nexter) and named in honor of General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, the commander of the Free French 2nd Armoured Division that advanced on Paris in World War II ["}

At his wits' end in the dark, Bilbo agreed to a riddle game with Gollum on the chance of being shown the way out of the mountains. In the first edition of \"The Hobbit\", Gollum's size is not stated. Only in the revised version is it specified that he is small and is actually an unnaturally long-lived Hobbit. Originally he was also characterized as being less bound to the Ring than in later versions; he offered to give the Ring to Bilbo if he lost the riddle game, and he showed Bilbo the way out of the mountains after losing. To fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien revised later editions of \"The Hobbit\": The version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the Dwarves and Gandalf. In the new version Gollum pretended that he would show Bilbo the way out if he lost the riddle-game, but he actually planned to use the Ring to kill and eat the hobbit. Discovering the Ring missing, he suddenly realized the answer to Bilbo's last riddle – \"What have I got in my pocket?\" – and flew into a rage. Bilbo inadvertently discovered the Ring's power of invisibility as he fled, allowing him to follow Gollum undetected to a back entrance of the caves. Gollum was convinced that Bilbo knew the way out all along, and hoped to intercept him near the entrance, lest the goblins apprehend Bilbo and find the Ring. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum in order to escape, but was overcome with pity, and so merely leaped over him. As Bilbo escaped, Gollum cried out, \"Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!\"\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Did Gollum know Bilbo before he was turned?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: No; by the time Bilbo Baggins encountered him, Gollum had already spent centuries under the Ring’s corrupting influence—his body and mind were “twisted” long before Bilbo discovered the Ring in the dark of the Misty Mountains—so the two never knew each other prior to Gollum’s transformation ["}

Krystal, meanwhile, remains defiant until the end. Ultimately, the experts agree that there is no need for a discussion over who is the worst of the final three; while Tyler made some major errors on his final drive and Daniella's poor track record, alongside her dangerous indecisiveness on the highway, may have caused her to be named the worst in many previous seasons, Krystal is agreed to be obviously the worst for her hostility and refusal to learn. Andrew, however, does express disappointment that they could not reach through to Krystal properly and feels that they failed as teachers this season. Cam, however, tells him not to feel that way, reminding him and the other experts that there have been others like Krystal (hinting at Colin Sheppard from \"Canada's Worst Driver 2\" and Scott Schurink from \"Canada's Worst Driver 6\") that were given an opportunity to make a change, but never took it seriously enough.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How many seasons does Canada's Worst Driver have?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Canada's Worst Driver has aired 14 seasons as of December 2018, making it the longest-running series in the international “Worst Driver” franchise ["}
