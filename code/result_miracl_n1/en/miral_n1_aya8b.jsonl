Partition was promoted for administrative reasons: Bengal was geographically as large as France and had a significantly larger population. Curzon stated the eastern region was neglected and under-governed. By splitting the province, an improved administration could be established in the east, where subsequently, the population would benefit from new schools and employment opportunities. The Hindus of West Bengal who dominated Bengal's business and rural life complained that the division would make them a minority in a province that would incorporate the province of Bihar and Orissa. Indians were outraged at what they recognised as a \"divide and rule\" policy.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How large is Bengal by area?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Bengal spans a total area of about 232,752 square kilometres, a territory that collectively includes the Indian state of West Bengal and the independent nation of Bangladesh ["}

Saturday & Sunday masses were held at Bishop Connolly High School. When the ruins were searched it was found that very little remained from the fire. One stained-glass window, \"The Flight into Egypt\", was spared destruction due to being in Connecticut for repair. The third Notre Dame was designed and built around this window. The three Angels that had adorned the Sanctuary Lamp and two candlesticks, though in the middle of the blaze, managed to survive the inferno. These too are part of the new church. The Sacred Heart Monument also miraculously survived the blaze even though it was in close proximity to the church. It wasn't until 1986 that the new church was built and ready for use. The orientation of the new building is reverse what the old one was. The new churches \"front\" sits in the footprint of the old churches \"rear\". In 2012, it was revealed that the parish of Notre Dame de Lourdes would be merging with the parish of Immaculate Conception in Fall River. This occurred in June 2012 and they will be using Notre Dame as their church, taking on the name St. Bernadette.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What denomination is St. Joseph's Church in Fall River?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Joseph’s Church in Fall River—including its location, construction date, architectural style, designer, and listing on the National Register of Historic Places—does not state the church’s religious denomination ["}

He was the first to apply the name trans-Antarctic Mountains (two years later, formalized as Transantarctic Mountains) to that 3,500 km range. Hamilton recognized that a large sector of this range contained distinctive granitic rocks like South Australia's Adelaide orogenic belt. Associated fossils of diverse ages in Antarctica, Australia, and southernmost Africa further linked these continents, and supported then-radical explanations of continental drift. Before traveling to Antarctica, Hamilton was what he later described as a \"closet drifter,\" aware that Southern Hemisphere geology provided powerful evidence favoring continental drift. He returned to Antarctica for fieldwork in 1963 and 1964 in other parts of the Transantarctic Mountains, including those once continuous with other Australian tracts. He also investigated in the field evidence for drift in Australia and South Africa, integrating his work with that of other researchers to show how Antarctica and other Gondwana continents had drifted apart.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How large is Antarctica?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Antarctica covers roughly 14 million km² (about 5.4 million mi²), making it the fifth-largest continent and approximately 1.3 times the size of Europe ["}

Consonant relationships are when two elements, such as your beliefs and actions, are in equilibrium with each other or coincide.

But according to Chamberlain, \"basketball was king in Philadelphia\", so he eventually turned to the sport. Because Chamberlain was a very tall child, already measuring at age 10 and when he entered Philadelphia's Overbrook High School, he had a natural advantage against his peers; he soon was renowned for his scoring talent, his physical strength and his shot blocking abilities. According to ESPN journalist Hal Bock, Chamberlain was \"scary, flat-out frightening... before he came along, most basketball players were mortal-sized men. Chamberlain changed that.\" It was also in this period of his life when his three lifelong nicknames \"Wilt the Stilt\", \"Goliath\", and his favorite, \"The Big Dipper\", were allegedly born.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When did Wilton Norman Chamberlain die?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Wilton Norman Chamberlain died on October 12, 1999 ["}

Panagoulis ignited a bomb at a point of the coastal road where the limousine carrying Papadopoulos would have to slow down, but the bomb failed to harm Papadopoulos. Panagoulis was captured a few hours later in a nearby sea cave, since the boat sent to help him escape was instructed to leave at a specific time and he couldn't swim there on time due to strong sea currents. After his arrest, he was taken to the Greek Military Police (EAT-ESA) offices where he was questioned, beaten and tortured. On 17 November 1968, Panagoulis was sentenced to death but was personally pardoned by Papadopoulos, served only five years in prison, and after democracy was restored was elected a member of Parliament.

The triple Xs were back on the company logo and were used on almost all of Pearl's advertisements. The Xs held this significant role to the end of production at the brewery in 2001, when the brewery closed its doors and the company logo was abandoned. As production of Pearl and Pearl Light spun up at Miller's Fort Worth facility, the product logos were redesigned.

However, Pearl's Country Club malt liquor still displays the XXXs in its logo.\nMany people wonder where the Xs came from, and how were they ever used on beer. In truth, the three Xs are actually a quality rating system. The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century. As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party. The courier's job was to sample beer at inns along the way. If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn's sign or door with a single X. If the inn's beer was deemed good, the sign or door would receive two Xs. A mark on an inn of three Xs meant that the beer inside was excellent, and a must-stop for the royal court as they passed through.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Pearl Brewing Company\nContent: The triple Xs were adopted by the San Antonio Brewing Association to portray two things: the high quality of their beers, and the pride that workers put into their products. The triple Xs may be gone from company and Pearl beer logos, but it has not completely vanished. In the 1960s, Pearl absorbed the Goetz Brewing Company and made Country Club Malt Liquor one of Pearl's key products. When Country Club received its only product makeover a few years after the buyout, it gained the triple Xs in its logo. The Xs were situated in the top-center of the logo's crown.

For all right triangles, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides ( a + b = c ). The theorem is named after Pythagoras of ancient Greece. Pythagorean triples occur when all three sides of a right triangle are integers such as a = 3, b = 4 and c = 5. A clay tablet shows that the Babylonians knew of Pythagorean triples 1200 years before Pythagoras, but nobody knows if they knew the more-general Pythagorean theorem. The Chinese proof uses four similar triangles to prove the theorem.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was the Pythagorean theorem developed?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The exact moment the Pythagorean theorem was developed is uncertain, but evidence shows it was already “well-known to the mathematicians of the Old Babylonian period,” roughly between the 20th and 16th centuries BC, more than a millennium before Pythagoras’s birth ["}

There are many axioms in the production of dentures that must be understood; ignorance of one axiom can lead to failure of the denture. In the vast majority of cases, complete dentures should be comfortable soon after insertion, although almost always at least two adjustment visits are necessary to remove the cause of sore spots. One of the most critical aspects of dentures is that the impression of the denture must be perfectly made and used with perfect technique to make an accurate model of the patient's edentulous (toothless) gums. The dentist or denturist must use a process called border molding to ensure that the denture flanges are properly extended. An array of problems may occur if the final impression of the denture is not made properly. It takes considerable patience and experience for a dentist to know how to make a denture, and for this reason it may be in the patient's best interest to seek a specialist, either a prosthodontist or denturist, to make the denture. A denturist is a trained and licensed professional who sees patients in need of dentures, partials, relines or repairs. A denturist not only takes the impression, but makes the entire denture in his or her own laboratory. The denturist then schedules a date for the delivery of the finished dentures to the patient. A general dentist may do a good job making dentures, but only if he or she is meticulous and experienced. Many dentists no longer make dentures themselves. but instead take an impression of the patients' mouth and then either send the impressions to a dental laboratory, which could be anywhere in the world, or send the patient to a denturist. Once the laboratory receives dental impressions of the patient's mouth, the laboratory creates plaster molds from them. The laboratory uses the molds to create the wax rims used to register the patient's bite. These wax rims are returned to the dentist, who uses them to register the patient's bite. The dentist may assist the patient in choosing the correct size of teeth for the dentures, or simply make the selection himself. Once bite registration is completed and the teeth are selected for the dentures, the wax rim is usually returned to the dental laboratory in order to have the denture teeth set into the wax. Once the teeth are set into the wax rim, the result is a prefinished denture that looks almost like the finished product. This prefinished denture is usually returned to the dentist's office and the patient usually has a chance to approve the setup (for immediate or standard dentures) or to try the denture before it is finished. After approval by the patient, the dentist returns the pre-denture to the laboratory for final processing. The finished denture is then returned to the dentist's office for delivery to the patient.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Denture cleaner\nContent: A denture cleaner (also termed denture cleanser), is a cleaner used to clean dentures when they are out of the mouth.

They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of the cubs varies – sometimes a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.\nWeaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest. When one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. Females often fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the male.

The network aired game shows in a 24-hour cycle, and also used live interstitials as wraparound programming. In its first few months, GSN's commercials consisted of public service announcements (PSAs), promotions for its programming and commercials related to network parent company Sony. By 1995, when the network began to expand, the network began accepting conventional advertising as it gained new sponsorships. On March 17, 1997, the Game Show Network rebranded with a new presentation package and a new logo (which had the network's name in boxes and a colorful swirling ball) and a new slogan \"All Play, All Day\".

In 1999, the network began a slate of original programming, including \"Inquizition\", \"All New 3's a Crowd\", and \"Hollywood Showdown\". The channel also launched original shows such as \"Extreme Gong\" (a remake of the classic \"Gong Show\").

Specialty drugs are often biologics—\"drugs derived from living cells\" that are injectable or infused (although some are oral medications). They are used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, H.I.V. psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and hepatitis C. In 1990 there were 10 specialty drugs on the market, in the mid-1990s there were fewer than 30, by 2008 there were 200, and by 2015 there were 300. Drugs are often defined as specialty because their price is much higher than that of non-specialty drugs. Medicare defines any drug for which the negotiated price is $670 per month or more, as a specialty drug which is placed in a specialty tier that requires a higher patient cost sharing. Drugs are also identified as specialty when there is a special handling requirement or the drug is only available via a limited distributions network. By 2015 \"specialty medications accounted for one-third of all spending on drugs in the United States, up from 19 percent in 2004 and heading toward 50 percent in the next 10 years\", according to IMS Health, which tracks prescriptions. According to a 2010 article in Forbes, specialty drugs for rare diseases became more expensive \"than anyone imagined\" and their success came \"at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses\" was \"in decline\". In 2015 analysis by \"The Wall Street Journal\" suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Specialty drugs in the United States\nContent: On September 27, 2007 President George W.

These medications were designated as specialty drugs and required specialty pharmacies. When the FDA approves a new drug they may require a REMS program which \"may contain any combination of 5 criteria: Medication Guide, Communication Plan, Elements to Assure Safe Use, Implementation System, and Timetable for Submission of Assessments\". \"In 2010, 48% of all new molecular entities, and 60% of all new specialty drug approvals, required a REMS program.\" Risk-reduction mechanisms can include the \"use of specialized distribution partners\", special pharmacy.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What year were specialty drugs designated?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The provided document does not name a specific calendar year in which the term “specialty drug” was formally designated; it states only that specialty drugs represent “a recent designation of pharmaceuticals” characterized by high cost, complexity, or required patient support ["}

Māori descend from a race of Polynesian sea-wanderers who, moved from East Asia and south-east Asia to the islands of the Pacific. Tradition tells of their further journeyings from Hawaiki to New Zealand, and some commentators have identified this homeland as Havai'i, an island in the Society Group. Overpopulation, scarcity of food and civil war forced many of them to migrate once more, and New Zealand became their new home. Māori settled New Zealand between AD 1280–1320. They quickly learnt to hunt the numerous species of moa and seals in New Zealand and settled across the North and South islands in less than a few decades. There is a change in the pollen record from inland Otago from 600 years ago from a forest to bracken flora. It has been inferred that this relates to fires being lit during Maori exploration.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: History of New Zealand\nContent: The history of New Zealand dates back at least 700 years to when it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori culture centred on kinship links and land. The first European explorer to sight New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel Tasman on 13 December 1642. The Dutch were also the first non-natives to explore and chart New Zealand's coastline. Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various Māori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving Māori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from Māori to Pākehā (European) ownership, and most Māori subsequently became impoverished.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was New Zealand first settled?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Archaeological and traditional evidence indicate that the first human settlement of New Zealand occurred when Polynesian ancestors of the Māori arrived between AD 1280 and 1320, marking the beginning of continuous habitation in the islands ["}

He was the second child and only son of Jonathan Swift (1640–1667) and his wife Abigail Erick (or Herrick) of Frisby on the Wreake. His father was a native of Goodrich, Herefordshire, but he accompanied his brothers to Ireland to seek their fortunes in law after their Royalist father's estate was brought to ruin during the English Civil War. His maternal grandfather, James Ericke, was the vicar of Thornton, England. In 1634 the vicar was convicted of Puritan practices. Some time thereafter, Ericke and his family, including his young daughter Abilgail, fled to Ireland.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: A Tale of a Tub\nContent: Born of English parents in Ireland, Jonathan Swift was working as Sir William Temple's secretary at the time he composed \"A Tale of a Tub\" (1694–1697). The publication of the work coincided with Swift's striking out on his own, having despaired of getting a good \"living\" from Temple or Temple's influence. There is speculation about what caused the rift between Swift and his employer, but, as A. C. Elias persuasively argues, it seems that the final straw came with Swift's work on Temple's \"Letters.\" Swift had been engaged to translate Temple's French correspondence, but Temple, or someone close to Temple, edited the French text to make Temple seem both prescient and more fluent. Consequently, the letters and the translations Swift provided did not gibe, and, since Swift could not accuse Temple of falsifying his letters, and because the public would never believe that the retired state minister had lied, Swift came across as incompetent.\nEven though Swift published the \"Tale\" as he left Temple's service, it was conceived earlier, and the book is a salvo in one of Temple's battles. Swift's general polemic concerns an argument (the \"Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns\") that had been over for nearly ten years by the time the book was published. The \"Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns\" was a French academic debate of the early 1690s, occasioned by Fontenelle arguing that modern scholarship had allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge. Temple argued against this position in his \"On Ancient and Modern Learning\" (where he provided the first English formulation of the commonplace that modern critics see more only because they are dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants), and Temple's somewhat naive essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were Richard Bentley (classicist and editor) and William Wotton (critic).\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Where was Jonathan Swift born?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, on 30 November 1667 ["}

The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species, and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species. Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex, while other axons terminate in the pretectal nucleus and are involved in reflexive eye movements. Other axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle.

In this sense there are many human 'races.' But this is not the sense in which many anthropologists, race-classifiers, and racists have used the term.\" He admits that in a biological sense, there is the existence of races within mankind. However, he also believes that not all of mankind can be classified. Part of his reasoning has to do with mixed origin, which has resulted in “overlapping” of physicalities. Instead of races and subspecies, he prefers mixed ethnic groups. His writing further emphasizes the complexity of our descent and rejects claims that support one race being superior when compared to others. He also says profoundly that the \"so-called\" main divisions of mankind are species instead of races.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Which race has the most people?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The race (ethnic group) with the greatest number of people is the Han Chinese, recognized as the world’s largest ethnic group; their predominant tongue, Mandarin, is likewise the most spoken native language globally ["}

Initially, he determined there should be a community of Benedictine monks at the new cathedral, performing the liturgies and singing the daily Office. This caused great resentment amongst the secular clergy of the diocese, who felt they were being snubbed. In the end, negotiations with both the English Benedictines and the community of French Benedictines at Farnborough failed and a 'traditional' choir of men and boys was set up instead. Despite great financial problems, the Choir School opened on 5 October 1901 with eleven boy choristers, in the building originally intended for the Benedictine monks. Cardinal Vaughan received the boys with the words \"You are the foundation stones\". The Cathedral Choir was officially instituted three months later in January 1902. Sung Masses and Offices were immediately established when the cathedral opened for worship in 1903, and have continued without interruption ever since.

In contrast, the Owen Falls (now flooded by a dam) between Victoria and Kyoga were essentially a series of rapids that did not effectively block fish movements between the two lakes.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How deep is Lake Victoria?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Lake Victoria is comparatively shallow for one of the African Great Lakes, attaining a maximum depth of about 80 m, with its average depth noted as significantly less (exact figure not specified in the source) ["}

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from spontaneous generation.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: University of Toronto\nContent: The discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is considered among the most significant events in the history of medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T-cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who first identified the cell?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Robert Hooke is credited as the first person to identify and describe cells, a discovery he made in the 17th century after improvements in microscope technology allowed him to observe the microscopic structure of cork and coin the term “cell” for the box-like structures he saw ["}

While traveling under the aegis of the Curtis Institute, he briefly played a loaned Stradivarius, which was exchanged for a Januarius Gagliano. In 1929 Temianka owned the violin made in 1752 by Joannes Baptista Guadagnini. In the 1930s he played a Silvestre violin, with which he made his early Vintage recordings, and subsequently a Januarius Gagliano and a Carlo Bergonzi.\nThe Stradivarius he played during the years of the Paganini Quartet was the \"Comte Cozio di Salabue\" of 1727, which was Paganini's own concert violin. It was later played by Martin Beaver, first violinist of the Tokyo String Quartet, which played since 1995 on the same quartet of Stradivarius instruments once owned by Paganini, until the Tokyo String Quartet retired in July 2013. These remarkable instruments—the viola had inspired Paganini to commission Hector Berlioz's \"Harold en Italie\"—were also played by the Cleveland Quartet for almost 15 years, beginning in 1982, and are presently owned by Nippon Music Foundation of Japan, after deacquisition by the Corcoran Gallery in the mid-1990s for $15 million. They were then played for several years by the Hagen Quartet, and are now in the hands of the Quartetto di Cremona.\nWhen the years of the Paganini Quartet came to an end, Temianka played a Michelangelo Bergonzi of 1759. His recordings of the Handel Sonatas were made on an Andrea Guarneri of 1687.In February 2013, Chapman University endowed the Henri Temianka Professorship in Music and Scholarship in String Studies. The violin played by Albert Saparoff, concertmaster of the Hollywood Symphony, was endowed as the Temianka-Saparoff violin, and is dedicated for the use of a selected recipient while studying there.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When were stradivarius violins made?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Stradivarius violins were crafted by the Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari mainly between about 1660 and his death in 1737, with the most coveted examples dating from his “golden period” of approximately 1700–1720; for example, the Stradivarius once owned by Paavo Berglund was built around 1700 ["}

Under the lords were other subjects such as serfs, who were bound and obliged to their lords, and to their lords' obligations. Merchants had a special status in the system, as did Jews. Jews were declared to be direct subjects of the king, unlike the rest of the population. This was an ambivalent legal position for the Jewish population, in that they were not tied to any particular lord but were subject to the whims of the king, it could be either advantageous or disadvantageous.

Major Jewish fortunes were made in London, Oxford, Lincoln, Bristol, and Norwich. The Crown, in turn, capitalized on the prosperity of its Jews. In addition to many arbitrary taxes, Richard I established the Ordinance of the Jewry in 1194 in an attempt to organize the Jewish community. It ensured that mandatory records would be kept by royal officials for all Jewish transactions. Every debt was recorded on a chirography to allow the king immediate and complete access to Jewish property. Richard also established a special exchequer to collect any unpaid debts due after the death of a Jewish creditor. The establishment of the Exchequer of the Jews eventually made all transactions of the English Jewry liable to taxation by the king in addition to the 10% of all sums recovered by Jews with the help of English courts. So, while the First and Second Crusades increased anti-Jewish sentiments, Jews in England went relatively unscathed beyond occasional fines and special levies. Though they did not experience the same kind of social mobility and cultural advancements that Jews under Muslim rule did, the Jews of England's population and prosperity increased under the protection of the king.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When did Jewish people first come to England?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jewish people first arrived in England in significant numbers in 1066, accompanying William the Conqueror after his Norman invasion and establishment of rule over the country ["}

She has appeared in many derivative works and merchandising, and has been referenced or parodied in several TV shows and films. Her \"cinnamon buns\" hairstyle from \"Star Wars\" (1977) and metal bikini from \"Return of the Jedi\" have become cultural icons.\nLeia was created by \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas, who in 1999 explained his early development of the main characters:\nIn the rough draft of \"Star Wars\", Leia is the spoiled teenage daughter of King Kayos and Queen Breha of Aquilae, with two brothers, Biggs and Windy; Biggs returned to the fourth draft as a childhood friend of Luke. Leia was at one point \"the daughter of Owen Lars and his wife Beru ...

A February 1978 cover story for the British teen magazine \"Jackie\" included step-by-step instructions on how to replicate Leia's hair buns. In the 1978 short film parody \"Hardware Wars\", Princess Anne-Droid has actual cinnamon buns on the side of her head. Miss Piggy of \"The Muppet Show\" copied the hairdo in a \"Star Wars\"-themed episode of the series in February 1980. In the 1987 Mel Brooks comedy film \"Spaceballs\", Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) appears to have the hairstyle, which is soon revealed to in fact be a large pair of headphones. In the parody film \"Thumb Wars\", the role of Leia was filled by a character named Princess Bunhead, who has two cinnamon rolls for hair. In 2015, Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd's character in the horror-comedy TV series \"Scream Queens\", a rich and disaffected sorority girl known as Chanel No. 3, wears earmuffs in every scene as an homage to Fisher's iconic Leia hairstyle.

Dimsdale was a member of the Alder Gulch Vigilance Committee and editor of the \"Montana Post.\" His early accounts of the Alder Gulch vigilante events are widely cited and the book version of his articles, the first book published in Montana Territory in 1866, has been extensively reprinted since its first edition.\nX. Biedler, one of the Alder Gulch and Helena vigilante enforcers wrote about his vigilante activities in his personal journals. They weren't available until well after his death when Helen F. Sanders, the daughter-in-law of Wilbur Sanders finally got them published in 1957. Nathaniel Langford, also a member of the vigilantes, explorer of the upper Yellowstone (1870), first superintendent of Yellowstone National Park (1872–1877), territorial tax collector (1864–1869) and author published \"Vigilante Days and Ways-Pioneers of the Rockies\" in 1893 after he returned to his home in Minnesota. In a 1912 speech to the Montana Historical Society, western historian, Olin Wheeler provided positive commentary on the Alder Gulch vigilantes in a tribute to the life of Nathaniel Langford.\nAnother account, not published until 1982, is that of former Montana Supreme Court Justice (1922–1935) Lew L. Callaway. Edited by his son Lew Callaway Jr., \"Montana's Righteous Hangmen:The Vigilantes in Action\" stems from Callaway's association with vigilante Captain James William in the late 1800s. Lew Callaway wrote extensively about the vigilantes and his stories which add more intimate details about how the vigilantes operated are captured in this volume. Although some vigilante activities during this period were criticized by citizens and civic leaders, there was a general affirmation of their purpose and contribution to law and order in a growing territory. Mark C. Dillon's \"Montana Vigilantes 1863–1870 Gold, Guns and Gallows\" (2013) concludes that given the lawless environment and criminal activity in Alder Gulch and Helena at the time, the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time, the vigilantes acted in a way they thought was best for their communities. He contends that judging the vigilantes by today's understanding and standards of due process is problematic.\nIn 2004, Frederick Allen, a journalist and historian, published \"A Decent and Orderly Lynching:The Montana Vigilantes\" reviewed as an up-to-day balanced account of Montana's vigilante history (1864–1870). Allen's book reinforces the motivations and methods of the earliest vigilantes in Alder Gulch while commenting on the growing disdain for vigilantism in the late 1860s. More generalist works on Montana history such as Merrill G. Burlingame's \"The Montana Frontier\" (1942) and Michael P. Malone's \"Montana-A History of Two Centuries\" (1991) adequately summarize the vigilante period largely based on earlier accounts by Dimsdale, Langford and Biedler. Additionally, many topical histories of Montana, such as novelist and Montana historian Dan Cushman's \"Montana: The Gold Frontier\" (1973) cover the vigilante period.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was the Montana Vigilantes formed?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The Montana Vigilantes were formed in 1863, when the mining camps of what was then eastern Idaho Territory lacked effective legal authority ["}

Major security software vendors (including Microsoft itself) planned to continue offering support and definitions for Windows XP past the end of support to varying extents, along with the developers of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera web browsers; despite these measures, critics similarly argued that users should eventually migrate from XP to a supported platform. The United States' Computer Emergency Readiness Team released an alert in March 2014 advising users of the impending end of support, and informing them that using XP after April 8 may prevent them from meeting US government information security requirements.\nMicrosoft continued to provide Security Essentials virus definitions and updates for its Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) for XP until July 14, 2015. As the end of extended support approached, Microsoft began to increasingly urge XP customers to migrate to newer versions such as Windows 7 or 8 in the interest of security, suggesting that attackers could reverse engineer security patches for newer versions of Windows and use them to target equivalent vulnerabilities in XP.

Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind.\"\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Ferengi\nContent: If a Ferengi navigates the river properly, he can accumulate wealth and distribute it throughout society, at various points along the river. This may demonstrate an important distinction, even in Ferengi culture, between selfishness and greed. Ferengi believe that greed, while essential to their concept of economics, is not inherently selfish, because the pursuit of greed serves a greater good. This is similar to the \"Greed is Good\" speech made by Gordon Gekko in the film \"Wall Street\". Alternatively, the concept may demonstrate that Ferengi culture views both selfishness and greed as completely compatible with improving the wealth of the universe as a whole.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Can greed be a good thing?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Greed—defined as an intense desire for more—can sometimes promote beneficial outcomes because the pursuit of personal gain often spurs risk-taking, efficiency improvements, and innovation that raise overall wealth; proponents such as financier Ivan Boesky argued in a 1986 Berkeley commencement address that “greed is healthy” and compatible with self-respect, a stance dramatized by Gordon Gekko’s “greed is good” speech in the 1987 film “Wall Street,” which claims greed “clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit” ["}

Depending on the species of bear, there is generally a preference for one class of food, as plants and animals are digested differently.

Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics. Plastics are the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Polymers that have been around, and that are in current widespread use, include carbon-based polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, nylons, polyesters, acrylics, polyurethane, and polycarbonates, and silicon-based silicones.

Inspired by them, polymerization methods, utilizing DNA or RNA as templates to control sequences of polymer, are developed. At first, taking DNA or RNA as templates, scientists developed a series of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based polymers, without using DNA polymerases. But this method is limited to polymerization scale and yield. After that, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is developed, which currently is still the most extensively used sequence-regulated method. By employing enzymes, the yields and scales are greatly increased, but the specificity of enzymes towards natural peptides limits this technique to a certain degree.

The universities offer a wide variety of courses on different levels.\nMultiple colleges and universities have historically had connections to the YMCA. Springfield College, of Springfield, Massachusetts, was founded in 1885 as an international training school for YMCA Professionals, while one of the two schools that eventually became Concordia University—Sir George Williams College—started from night courses offered at the Montreal YMCA. Northeastern University began out of a YMCA in Boston, and Franklin University began as the YMCA School of Commerce. San Francisco's Golden Gate University traces its roots to the founding of the YMCA Night School on 1 November 1881. Detroit College of Law, now the Michigan State University College of Law, was founded with a strong connection to the Detroit, Michigan YMCA. It had a 99-year lease on the site, and it was only when it expired that the college moved to East Lansing, Michigan. Youngstown State University traces its roots to the establishment of a law school by the local YMCA in 1908. The Nashville School of Law was the YMCA Night Law School until November 1986, having offered law classes since 1911 and the degree of Juris Doctor since January 1927. YMCA pioneered the concept of night school, providing educational opportunities for people with full-time employment. Many YMCAs offer ESL programmes, alternative high school, day care, and summer camp programs. In India, YMCA University of Science and Technology Faridabad was founded in 1969.

After the Kingdom of Italy was established he decided to continue on as King Victor Emmanuel II instead of Victor Emmanuel I of Italy. This was a terrible move as far as public relations went as it was not indicative of the fresh start that the Italian people wanted and suggested that Sardinia-Piedmont had taken over the Italian Peninsula, rather than unifying it. Despite this mishap, the remainder of Victor Emmanuel II's reign was consumed by wrapping up loose ends and dealing with economic and cultural issues. His role in day-to-day governing gradually dwindled, as it became increasingly apparent that a king could no longer keep a government in office against the will of Parliament.

The current World Fast Draw Association (WFDA) record for Open Class Fast Draw in an event called Standing Balloons is .208 seconds - and that includes the time it takes to react, draw, fire and pop a balloon target at eight feet away. A world class competitor can draw and fire a shot in under half a second. Given that the average human reaction time is around 0.2 to 0.25 seconds, the round is over before most people can react. The reaction times of the best fast draw shooters is 0.145 seconds, which means that the gun is cocked, drawn, aimed (from the hip), and fired in just over 0.06 seconds. To establish a World Fast Draw Association record, a second shot must be fired in the same competition that is no more than 0.30 seconds slower than the first; this is intended to prevent a shot that anticipates the start signal from setting a record. In competitions where two rounds must be fired, at separate targets, less than 0.10 seconds separate the shots.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How fast is the fastest firing machine gun?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The fastest-firing machine gun commonly fielded is the electrically driven M134 Minigun, whose six rotating barrels can sustain over 100 rounds per second, equivalent to about 6,000 rounds per minute (RPM) in cyclic rate of fire ["}

He also worked on methods of detecting submarines during World War I. He applied for the first patent on a seismic exploration method in 1914, which was issued in 1917. Due to the war, he was unable to follow up on the idea. John Clarence Karcher discovered seismic reflections independently while working for the United States Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) on methods of sound ranging to detect artillery. In discussion with colleagues, the idea developed that these reflections could aid in exploration for petroleum. With several others, many affiliated with the University of Oklahoma, Karcher helped to form the Geological Engineering Company, incorporated in Oklahoma in April, 1920. The first field tests were conducted near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1921.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Reflection seismology\nContent: Reflection seismology (or seismic reflection) is a method of exploration geophysics that uses the principles of seismology to estimate the properties of the Earth's subsurface from reflected seismic waves. The method requires a controlled seismic source of energy, such as dynamite or Tovex blast, a specialized air gun or a seismic vibrator, commonly known by the trademark name Vibroseis. Reflection seismology is similar to sonar and echolocation. This article is about surface seismic surveys; for vertical seismic profiles, see VSP.\nReflections and refractions of seismic waves at geologic interfaces within the Earth were first observed on recordings of earthquake-generated seismic waves. The basic model of the Earth's deep interior is based on observations of earthquake-generated seismic waves transmitted through the Earth’s interior (e.g., Mohorovičić, 1910). The use of human-generated seismic waves to map in detail the geology of the upper few kilometers of the Earth's crust followed shortly thereafter and has developed mainly due to commercial enterprise, particularly the petroleum industry.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who first developed reflection seismology?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Fessenden is credited as the first developer of reflection seismology, having conceived the idea of using reflected seismic waves to infer subsurface geology, applied for the initial seismic exploration patent in 1914 (issued 1917), and carried out early research on acoustic‐wave propagation following the Titanic disaster of 1912 and during World War I submarine‐detection work ["}

Legend claims that Rugby football was started around the time of 1845 in Rugby School, Rugby, Warwickshire, England, although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times. Rugby eventually split into two sports in 1895 when twenty one clubs split from the original Rugby Football Union, to form the Northern Union (later to be named rugby league in 1922) in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, Northern England over the issue of payment to players, thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay its players, rugby union turned fully professional in 1995. Both sports are run by their respective world governing bodies World Rugby (rugby union) and the Rugby League International Federation (rugby league). Rugby football was one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports.

The bridge was a part of a citywide paving and improvement project to prepare Charlottesville area streets for the automobile. Although it was originally known simply as the Rugby Road Bridge, when the Beta Theta Pi fraternity built their house at the corner of Chancellor and Rugby in 1927, it took its current name. In 1971, that fraternity location was closed, and the Delta Upsilon fraternity moved into its current location at 180 Rugby Road. As the unofficial monitors of the bridge, brothers and pledges of DU would paint over offensive messages or messages which did not contain 'THX DU' (for \"Thanks Delta Upsilon\"). In 2011, Beta Theta Pi moved back into their original house next to the bridge, and now messages typically contain 'THX Beta'.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Where did Rugby originate?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Rugby originated at Rugby School in the town of Rugby, Warwickshire, England, where legend places the beginning of the sport around 1845 ["}

Part is a three-times World Champion, having won the 1994 BDO World Darts Championship, and the PDC World Championship in 2003 and 2008. He is statistically North America's greatest darts player to date. He has the distinction of being the first non-UK player to win the World Championship, and the only non-European to date to win the PDC World Darts Championship. His first Championship was the second time a non-seeded player won the BDO World Darts Championship, and one of the few times where a player only lost one set in the entire tournament. His nine year gap between his first and second World Championships is tied with Ted Hankey for the longest gap between World Championships, and his third triumph in 2008 saw him become the first player in history to win a world title in three different venues, and the first to win at the Alexandra Palace. His 2008 win saw him join Phil Taylor, Eric Bristow, Raymond van Barneveld and John Lowe as the only players with three or more World Championships, and become only the second player (after Taylor) to win multiple PDC titles.

One of the people believing Red John to be dead is James Panzer, a blogger pretending to devote his life to find a serial killer known as \"the San Joaquin Killer\" (abbreviated SJK, who has killed at least five young women). In reality, Panzer is the killer. Jane suspects Panzer but initially lacks the proof to expose him. When he and Panzer both appear on Karen Cross's television talk show discussing the SJK case, Jane recognizes Panzer has to be stopped and goads Panzer into comparing Red John unfavorably to SJK. Panzer rises to the bait, making bold statements that the SJK killings were the work of a genius and Red John by comparison is a \"\"common sociopath, lazy, sloppy, delusional\"\" and already forgotten since Jane killed him. Panzer then makes the same mistake made by Jane and Kristina Frye: belittling Red John in a public forum. A couple of hours after the television appearance, Panzer is found murdered, with Red John's smiley face painted in blood on one of the walls near his body. Panzer's murder proves Jane's theory that Red John is still alive. This makes Panzer Red John's ninth male victim.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Is John Part still alive?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Yes—John Part is still alive; the document states that he “is a Canadian professional darts player and commentator,” notes his birth date as 29 June 1966, and provides no indication of a date of death, all of which imply he remains living today ["}

Their cavalry tank class filled the role of what are now called MBTs. They also fielded a heavy tank design, and several lighter types for scouting and infantry support. In addition to these types, they were also working on super-heavy breakthrough tanks (FCM F1). The French didn't have an independent Tank Corps. All tanks belonged to either the Infantry or the Cavalry.The Renault FT-17 had a long life and saw use in World War II and even later in Indochina. It was utilised as far away as in China, during the Chinese Civil wars, and versions of the tank were used both against and by the Japanese during the invasion of China. A large number found their way into both Republican and Nationalist hands during the Spanish Civil War. They were used in the Russian Revolution by both the Bolsheviks and the White Russians, and later by the Finns against the Soviets. France exported the FT-17 right up to World War II. The design was also developed by the Italians as the Fiat 3000 and the USSR as the T-18.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is the current French tank?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The current main battle tank in service with the French Army is the Leclerc tank, a modern MBT designed and produced by the French manufacturer GIAT (renamed Nexter) and named in honor of General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, the commander of the Free French 2nd Armoured Division that advanced on Paris in World War II ["}

The \"robot\" ended up being slow and expensive to run, using money that might be better spent on other library concerns, particularly acquisition and digital development.

While the U.S. switchover deadline of 17 February was later pushed back to 12 June 2009 and only applied to American-licensed stations in any case, plans were announced to voluntarily make the station's English-language programming digital-only. The analog signal would be repurposed to retransmit the Mexican Galavisión network (not to be confused with the American cable channel of the same name). Claims on XETV's website that the station was indeed going to transmit a digitally-exclusive signal were rescinded on 17 February 2009 as the station decided to delay cutting off its analog signal until after it secured approval from the Mexican government. XETV management later stated that it had decided to maintain its analog signal to benefit Mexican viewers. XETV's analog signal was eventually repurposed on 5 March 2012, when the station began multicasting on its digital signal with the addition of Televisa's youth-oriented Canal 5 network on subchannel 6.2 and on its analog feed, while digital channel 6.1 retained the newscasts, CW network and syndicated programs in English. On the same date, XHBJ-TV channel 45 dropped Canal 5 for Galavisión. Canal 5 replaced XETV's English-language programming on its analog signal, in order to serve Spanish-speaking viewers in Tijuana that did not have television sets with built-in digital tuners or digital converter boxes prior to the Tijuana market's 2013 transition to digital television. The affiliation switch coincided with the commencement of digital multicasting on Televisa's Tijuana stations. Canal 5 moved to its primary channel on 31 May 2017, at which point, the 6.2 subchannel was decommissioned.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: XETV-TDT\nContent: Because XETV-TDT is licensed to Tijuana by the Mexican government, it is not covered under the FCC's must carry rules.

As an English-language station XETV had been carried by Cox Communications, Time Warner Cable (now Charter Spectrum) and AT&T U-verse in San Diego, all on channel 6. KFMB-TV's \"The CW San Diego\" has replaced XETV on the American cable systems, as well as satellite television providers DirecTV and Dish Network. XETV is carried by all Mexican cable systems in its coverage area, as carriage of local broadcast stations is mandated by the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT).\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Does XETV-TDT have a website?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Yes, XETV-TDT does have an official website; this is evidenced by the fact that “claims on XETV's website that the station was indeed going to transmit a digitally-exclusive signal were rescinded on 17 February 2009,” proving that the station maintained an online presence to publish and later retract such information ["}

After the elder Snart insults him and his mother, calling them weak, Cold punches him, but finds himself unable to kill him, instead getting Heat Wave to do it. The Rogues have their confrontation with Inertia, despite interference by Zoom and Libra, and kill Inertia. Libra then reveals that he needs the Rogues because Barry Allen has returned from the dead, and the Flashes are potential threats to him and Darkseid. Though shocked by the news that Allen is alive, Cold still rejects his offer of membership. After regrouping, Cold and the other Rogues agree not to retire, claiming that the game is back on.

However, efforts to rebuild the carrier force were unsuccessful since the training given to new aviators was of a very low standard. Consequently, the new carriers never went to sea with a full air group. This left the Japanese with a ragtag collection of carriers, led by the \"Zuikaku\", which was the sole survivor of the Pearl Harbor attack force. The Japanese were left with two choices, either to commit their remaining strength in an all-out offensive, or to sit by while the Americans occupied the Philippines and cut the sea lanes between Japan and vital resources from the Dutch East Indies and Malaya. The plan devised by the Japanese was a final attempt to create a decisive battle by utilizing their last remaining strength, the firepower of its heavy cruisers and battleships, which were to be all committed against the American beachhead at Leyte.

Bilbo Baggins found the Ring and took it for his own, and Gollum afterwards pursued it for the rest of his life.

At his wits' end in the dark, Bilbo agreed to a riddle game with Gollum on the chance of being shown the way out of the mountains. In the first edition of \"The Hobbit\", Gollum's size is not stated. Only in the revised version is it specified that he is small and is actually an unnaturally long-lived Hobbit. Originally he was also characterized as being less bound to the Ring than in later versions; he offered to give the Ring to Bilbo if he lost the riddle game, and he showed Bilbo the way out of the mountains after losing. To fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien revised later editions of \"The Hobbit\": The version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the Dwarves and Gandalf. In the new version Gollum pretended that he would show Bilbo the way out if he lost the riddle-game, but he actually planned to use the Ring to kill and eat the hobbit. Discovering the Ring missing, he suddenly realized the answer to Bilbo's last riddle – \"What have I got in my pocket?\" – and flew into a rage. Bilbo inadvertently discovered the Ring's power of invisibility as he fled, allowing him to follow Gollum undetected to a back entrance of the caves. Gollum was convinced that Bilbo knew the way out all along, and hoped to intercept him near the entrance, lest the goblins apprehend Bilbo and find the Ring. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum in order to escape, but was overcome with pity, and so merely leaped over him. As Bilbo escaped, Gollum cried out, \"Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins!

The series is produced by Proper Television, whose president, Guy O'Sullivan, was the director of the original \"Britain's Worst Driver\" series until its cancellation in 2003. O'Sullivan served as executive producer of \"Canada's Worst Driver\" until his death in April 2017, doubling as executive producer of sister series \"Canada's Worst Handyman\" until its cancellation in 2011. As such, \"Canada's Worst Driver\" is considered to be the production company's flagship show and, with 14 seasons aired as of December 2018, the longest-running of any \"Worst\" series to date. Unlike other \"Worst\" series around the world, where being a graduate is rewarded with a new car while the Worst Driver has their car destroyed, \"Canada's Worst Driver\" emphasizes the learning process of the contestants and the science of driving and is often more serious than any other \"Worst Driver\" version around the world, awarding no prizes aside from a trophy at the end of each season for being named the worst (with the exception of season twelve, in which, despite ultimately being named the worst, Krystal McCann wasn't even worthy of being awarded the trophy, leading to Tyler Dupont becoming the first-ever nominee to be awarded the \"Final Graduate\" trophy), as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain, as other versions are mainly comedic.

Krystal, meanwhile, remains defiant until the end. Ultimately, the experts agree that there is no need for a discussion over who is the worst of the final three; while Tyler made some major errors on his final drive and Daniella's poor track record, alongside her dangerous indecisiveness on the highway, may have caused her to be named the worst in many previous seasons, Krystal is agreed to be obviously the worst for her hostility and refusal to learn. Andrew, however, does express disappointment that they could not reach through to Krystal properly and feels that they failed as teachers this season. Cam, however, tells him not to feel that way, reminding him and the other experts that there have been others like Krystal (hinting at Colin Sheppard from \"Canada's Worst Driver 2\" and Scott Schurink from \"Canada's Worst Driver 6\") that were given an opportunity to make a change, but never took it seriously enough.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How many seasons does Canada's Worst Driver have?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Canada's Worst Driver has aired 14 seasons as of December 2018, making it the longest-running series in the international “Worst Driver” franchise ["}

In contrast, project management is about doing projects right. And also according to this view, successful projects deliver on time, to budget and to specification, whereas successful programs deliver long term improvements to an organization. Improvements are usually identified through benefits. An organization should select the group of programs that most take it towards its strategic aims while remaining within its capacity to deliver the changes.

Most observations occur when their soft voice is heard, or in flight when flushed from the dense scrub. Males and females are similar in colouring and bond as lifelong pairs that occupy a territory centred on their roosting and brooding nest site.

Simon's greatest triumph was the victory against superior numbers at the Battle of Muret—a battle which saw not only the defeat of Raymond of Toulouse and his Occitan allies—but also the death of Peter of Aragon—and the effective end of the ambitions of the house of Aragon/Barcelona in the Languedoc. This was in the medium and longer term of much greater significance to the royal house of France than it was to de Montfort—and with the battle of Bouvines was to secure the position of Philip Augustus vis a vis England and the Empire.
