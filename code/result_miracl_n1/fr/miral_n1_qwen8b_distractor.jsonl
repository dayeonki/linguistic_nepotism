La partition a eu lieu le 16 octobre 1905 et séparait les zones orientales largement musulmanes des zones occidentales en grande partie hindoues. L'ancienne province du Bengale a été divisée en deux nouvelles provinces \"Bengale\" (comprenant le Bengale occidental ainsi que la province du Bihar et de l'Orissa) et du Bengale oriental et de l'Assam avec Dacca comme capitale de la seconde. La partition a été promue pour des raisons administratives: le Bengale était géographiquement aussi important que la France et avait une population beaucoup plus importante. Curzon a déclaré que la région orientale était négligée et sous régime. En divisant la province, une administration améliorée pourrait être établie à l'est, où par la suite, la population bénéficierait de nouvelles écoles et de possibilités d'emploi. Les hindous du Bengale occidental qui ont dominé les affaires et la vie rurale du Bengale se plaignaient que la division en ferait une minorité dans une province qui incorporerait la province du Bihar et de l'Orissa. Les Indiens étaient indignés par ce qu'ils ont reconnu comme une politique de «diviser et règle».\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How large is Bengal by area?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Bengal spans a total area of about 232,752 square kilometres, a territory that collectively includes the Indian state of West Bengal and the independent nation of Bangladesh ["}

Une fenêtre de verre taché, \"le vol en Égypte\", a été épargnée de destruction en raison du Connecticut pour réparation. Le troisième Notre Dame a été conçu et construit autour de cette fenêtre. Les trois anges qui avaient orné la lampe du sanctuaire et deux chandeliers, bien qu'au milieu de l'incendie, ont réussi à survivre à l'enfer. Ceux-ci font également partie de la nouvelle église. Le monument du Sacré-Cœur a également miraculeusement survécu à l'incendie même s'il était à proximité de l'église. Ce n'est qu'en 1986 que la nouvelle église a été construite et prête à l'emploi. L'orientation du nouveau bâtiment est inversée ce que l'ancien était. Les nouvelles églises \"Front\" se trouvent dans l'empreinte des anciennes églises \"arrière\". En 2012, il a été révélé que la paroisse de Notre Dame de Lourdes fusionnerait avec la paroisse de la conception immaculée à Fall River.

Hamilton\nContent: Hamilton a dirigé une fête sur le terrain à deux en Antarctique (octobre 1958 à janvier 1959) pour l'année géophysique internationale et a lancé une nouvelle compréhension de l'Antarctique. Il a été le premier à appliquer le nom des montagnes trans-anarctiques (deux ans plus tard, formalisées comme des montagnes transantarctiques) à cette fourchette de 3 500 km. Hamilton a reconnu qu'un grand secteur de cette gamme contenait des roches granitiques distinctives comme la ceinture orogénique d'Adélaïde d'Australie du Sud. Les fossiles associés de divers âges en Antarctique, en Australie et en Afrique la plus au sud ont davantage lié ces continents, et ont soutenu les explications radicales de l'époque de la dérive continentale. Avant de se rendre en Antarctique, Hamilton a été ce qu'il a décrit plus tard comme un «drifter de placard», conscient que la géologie de l'hémisphère sud a fourni des preuves puissantes favorisant la dérive continentale. Il est retourné en Antarctique pour un travail sur le terrain en 1963 et 1964 dans d'autres parties des montagnes transantarctiques, y compris celles autrefois continues avec d'autres tracts australiens. Il a également enquêté sur les preuves sur le terrain de la dérive en Australie et en Afrique du Sud, intégrant son travail à celle d'autres chercheurs pour montrer comment l'Antarctique et d'autres continents du Gondwana s'étaient séparés.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How large is Antarctica?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Antarctica covers roughly 14 million km² (about 5.4 million mi²), making it the fifth-largest continent and approximately 1.3 times the size of Europe ["}

Il était un enfant frêle, mourant presque de pneumonie dans ses premières années et manquant une année entière d'école en conséquence. Dans ses premières années, Chamberlain n'était pas intéressé par le basket-ball, car il pensait que c'était \"un jeu pour les sissies\". Au lieu de cela, il était un athlète passionné d'athlétisme: en tant que jeune, il a sauté en hauteur de 6 pieds, 6 pouces, a couru les 440 verges en 49,0 secondes et les 880 verges en 1: 58,3, a mis le tir de 53 pieds, 4 pouces et un large a sauté 22 pieds. Mais selon Chamberlain, \"le basket-ball était roi à Philadelphie\", alors il s'est finalement tourné vers le sport. Parce que Chamberlain était un enfant très grand, mesurant déjà à l'âge de 10 ans et quand il est entré au lycée Overbrook de Philadelphie, il avait un avantage naturel contre ses pairs; Il a rapidement été réputé pour son talent de notation, sa force physique et ses capacités de blocage de tir. Selon le journaliste ESPN Hal Bock, Chamberlain était \"effrayant et effrayant ... avant son arrivée, la plupart des basketteurs étaient des hommes de la taille d'un mortel. Chamberlain a changé cela.\" C'était aussi dans cette période de sa vie où ses trois surnoms de toujours \"Wilt the Still\", \"Goliath\" et son préféré, \"The Big Dipper\", auraient été nés.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When did Wilton Norman Chamberlain die?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Wilton Norman Chamberlain died on October 12, 1999 ["}

As production of Pearl and Pearl Light spun up at Miller's Fort Worth facility, the product logos were redesigned.

However, Pearl's Country Club malt liquor still displays the XXXs in its logo.\nMany people wonder where the Xs came from, and how were they ever used on beer. In truth, the three Xs are actually a quality rating system. The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century. As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party. The courier's job was to sample beer at inns along the way. If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn's sign or door with a single X. If the inn's beer was deemed good, the sign or door would receive two Xs. A mark on an inn of three Xs meant that the beer inside was excellent, and a must-stop for the royal court as they passed through.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Pearl Brewing Company\nContent: Les Triple XS ont été adoptés par la San Antonio Brewing Association pour représenter deux choses: la haute qualité de leurs bières et la fierté que les travailleurs ont mis dans leurs produits.

Dans les années 1960, Pearl a absorbé la Goetz Brewing Company et a fait de Country Club Malt Liquor l'un des principaux produits de Pearl. Lorsque Country Club a reçu sa seule cure de jouvence de produits quelques années après le rachat, il a gagné le Triple XS dans son logo. Les X étaient situés dans le centre supérieur de la couronne du logo. Country Club est toujours produit aujourd'hui, et il porte toujours la marque «xxx» de Pearl.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Is Pearl beer still in production?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Yes—while Pearl’s historic San Antonio brewery shut down in 2001, production of Pearl and Pearl Light was transferred to Miller’s facility in Fort Worth, so the brand continues to be brewed even though the original plant and its traditional triple-X logo were retired ["}

There are many axioms in the production of dentures that must be understood; ignorance of one axiom can lead to failure of the denture. In the vast majority of cases, complete dentures should be comfortable soon after insertion, although almost always at least two adjustment visits are necessary to remove the cause of sore spots. One of the most critical aspects of dentures is that the impression of the denture must be perfectly made and used with perfect technique to make an accurate model of the patient's edentulous (toothless) gums. The dentist or denturist must use a process called border molding to ensure that the denture flanges are properly extended. An array of problems may occur if the final impression of the denture is not made properly. It takes considerable patience and experience for a dentist to know how to make a denture, and for this reason it may be in the patient's best interest to seek a specialist, either a prosthodontist or denturist, to make the denture. A denturist is a trained and licensed professional who sees patients in need of dentures, partials, relines or repairs. A denturist not only takes the impression, but makes the entire denture in his or her own laboratory. The denturist then schedules a date for the delivery of the finished dentures to the patient. A general dentist may do a good job making dentures, but only if he or she is meticulous and experienced. Many dentists no longer make dentures themselves. but instead take an impression of the patients' mouth and then either send the impressions to a dental laboratory, which could be anywhere in the world, or send the patient to a denturist. Once the laboratory receives dental impressions of the patient's mouth, the laboratory creates plaster molds from them. The laboratory uses the molds to create the wax rims used to register the patient's bite. These wax rims are returned to the dentist, who uses them to register the patient's bite. The dentist may assist the patient in choosing the correct size of teeth for the dentures, or simply make the selection himself. Once bite registration is completed and the teeth are selected for the dentures, the wax rim is usually returned to the dental laboratory in order to have the denture teeth set into the wax. Once the teeth are set into the wax rim, the result is a prefinished denture that looks almost like the finished product. This prefinished denture is usually returned to the dentist's office and the patient usually has a chance to approve the setup (for immediate or standard dentures) or to try the denture before it is finished. After approval by the patient, the dentist returns the pre-denture to the laboratory for final processing. The finished denture is then returned to the dentist's office for delivery to the patient.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Nettoyeur de prothèse\nContent: Un nettoyant de prothèse (également appelé nettoyant dentaire), est un nettoyant utilisé pour nettoyer les prothèses dentaires lorsqu'elles sont hors de la bouche.

The network aired game shows in a 24-hour cycle, and also used live interstitials as wraparound programming. In its first few months, GSN's commercials consisted of public service announcements (PSAs), promotions for its programming and commercials related to network parent company Sony.

Specialty drugs are often biologics—\"drugs derived from living cells\" that are injectable or infused (although some are oral medications). They are used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, H.I.V. psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and hepatitis C. In 1990 there were 10 specialty drugs on the market, in the mid-1990s there were fewer than 30, by 2008 there were 200, and by 2015 there were 300. Drugs are often defined as specialty because their price is much higher than that of non-specialty drugs. Medicare defines any drug for which the negotiated price is $670 per month or more, as a specialty drug which is placed in a specialty tier that requires a higher patient cost sharing. Drugs are also identified as specialty when there is a special handling requirement or the drug is only available via a limited distributions network. By 2015 \"specialty medications accounted for one-third of all spending on drugs in the United States, up from 19 percent in 2004 and heading toward 50 percent in the next 10 years\", according to IMS Health, which tracks prescriptions. According to a 2010 article in Forbes, specialty drugs for rare diseases became more expensive \"than anyone imagined\" and their success came \"at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses\" was \"in decline\". In 2015 analysis by \"The Wall Street Journal\" suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Médicaments spécialisés aux États-Unis\nContent: Le 27 septembre 2007, le président George W.

Māori descend from a race of Polynesian sea-wanderers who, moved from East Asia and south-east Asia to the islands of the Pacific. Tradition tells of their further journeyings from Hawaiki to New Zealand, and some commentators have identified this homeland as Havai'i, an island in the Society Group. Overpopulation, scarcity of food and civil war forced many of them to migrate once more, and New Zealand became their new home. Māori settled New Zealand between AD 1280–1320. They quickly learnt to hunt the numerous species of moa and seals in New Zealand and settled across the North and South islands in less than a few decades. There is a change in the pollen record from inland Otago from 600 years ago from a forest to bracken flora. It has been inferred that this relates to fires being lit during Maori exploration.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Histoire de la Nouvelle-Zélande\nContent: L'histoire de la Nouvelle-Zélande remonte à au moins 700 ans pour avoir été découverte et établie par les Polynésiens, qui ont développé une culture maorie distincte centrée sur des liens et des terres. Le premier explorateur européen à voir la Nouvelle-Zélande a été le navigateur néerlandais Abel Tasman le 13 décembre 1642. Les néerlandais ont également été les premiers non-autochtones à explorer et à tracer le littoral de la Nouvelle-Zélande. Le capitaine James Cook, qui a atteint la Nouvelle-Zélande en octobre 1769 lors du premier de ses trois voyages, a été le premier explorateur européen à faire le tour et à cartographier la Nouvelle-Zélande. À la fin du XVIIIe siècle, le pays était régulièrement visité par des explorateurs et autres marins, missionnaires, commerçants et aventuriers. En 1840, le traité de Waitangi a été signé entre la Couronne britannique et divers chefs maoris, amenant la Nouvelle-Zélande dans l'Empire britannique et donnant aux Māori les mêmes droits que les sujets britanniques. Il y avait une vaste colonie britannique tout au long du reste du siècle et jusqu'au début du siècle prochain. La guerre et l'imposition d'un système économique et juridique européen ont conduit à la majeure partie des terres de la Nouvelle-Zélande qui passent des maoris à la propriété de Pākehā (européenne), et la plupart des Maoris sont devenus appauvris.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was New Zealand first settled?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Archaeological and traditional evidence indicate that the first human settlement of New Zealand occurred when Polynesian ancestors of the Māori arrived between AD 1280 and 1320, marking the beginning of continuous habitation in the islands ["}

La publication de l'œuvre a coïncidé avec Swift en train de retirer par lui-même, ayant désespéré de recevoir une bonne \"vie\" de l'influence du temple ou du temple. Il y a des spéculations sur ce qui a causé la faille entre Swift et son employeur, mais, comme le fait valoir A. C. Elias de manière convaincante, il semble que la paille finale soit venue avec le travail de Swift sur les \"lettres\" de Temple. Swift avait été fiancé pour traduire la correspondance française de Temple, mais Temple, ou quelqu'un proche de Temple, a édité le texte français pour faire paraître Temple à la fois prémonitoire et plus couramment. Par conséquent, les lettres et les traductions ont fourni que Swift ne gibe pas et, puisque Swift ne pouvait pas accuser le temple de falsifier ses lettres, et parce que le public ne croirait jamais que le ministre de l'État à la retraite avait menti, Swift est apparu comme incompétent.\nMême si Swift a publié le \"conte\" en quittant le service de Temple, il a été conçu plus tôt, et le livre est une salve dans l'une des batailles du Temple. La polémique générale de Swift concerne un argument (la \"querelle des anciens et des modernes\") qui était terminée depuis près de dix ans au moment de la publication du livre. La «querelle des anciens et des modernes» était un débat académique français du début des années 1690, occasionné par Fontenelle, arguant que la bourse moderne avait permis à l'homme moderne de dépasser les anciens de la connaissance. Temple s'est opposé à cette position dans son \"apprentissage ancien et moderne\" (où il a fourni la première formulation anglaise du commun que les critiques modernes ne voient plus que parce qu'ils sont des nains debout sur les épaules des géants), et l'essai quelque peu naïf de Temple a provoqué une petite rafale de réponses. Entre autres, deux hommes qui ont pris le camp opposé à Temple étaient Richard Bentley (classique et rédacteur) et William Wotton (critique).\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Where was Jonathan Swift born?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, on 30 November 1667 ["}

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from spontaneous generation.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Université de Toronto\nContent: La découverte de l'insuline à l'Université de Toronto en 1921 est considérée parmi les événements les plus importants de l'histoire de la médecine. La cellule souche a été découverte à l'université en 1963, formant la base de la transplantation de la moelle osseuse et de toutes les recherches ultérieures sur les cellules souches adultes et embryonnaires. Il s'agissait de la première de nombreuses résultats à Toronto concernant les cellules souches, y compris l'identification des cellules souches pancréatiques et rétiniennes. La cellule souche cancéreuse a été identifiée pour la première fois en 1997 par des chercheurs de Toronto, qui ont depuis trouvé des associations de cellules souches dans la leucémie, les tumeurs cérébrales et le cancer colorectal. Les inventions médicales développées à Toronto comprennent l'indice glycémique, le Pablum céréale infantile, l'utilisation de l'hypothermie protectrice en chirurgie cardiaque ouverte et le premier stimulateur cardiaque artificiel. La première greffe de poumon unique réussie a été réalisée à Toronto en 1981, suivie de la première transplantation nerveuse en 1988, et de la première transplantation à double poumon en 1989. Des chercheurs ont identifié le facteur de promotion de maturation qui régule la division cellulaire et a découvert le récepteur des lymphocytes T, qui déclenche des réponses du système immunitaire. L'université est reconnue pour isoler les gènes qui provoquent une anémie de Fanconi, une fibrose kystique et une maladie d'Alzheimer à début précoce, parmi de nombreuses autres maladies. Entre 1914 et 1972, l'université a exploité les Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, qui fait maintenant partie de la Pharmaceutical Corporation Sanofi-aventis.

One proposed explanation for this dearth of cloud features is that Uranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low internal thermal flux. Why Uranus's heat flux is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun. Uranus, by contrast, radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere. In fact, Uranus's heat flux is only  W/m², which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 0.075 W/m². The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49 K (−224 °C), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System, colder than Neptune.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Uranus\nContent: La chaleur interne d'Uranus semble nettement inférieure à celle des autres planètes géantes; En termes astronomiques, il a un faible flux thermique.

La puissance totale rayonnée par Uranus dans la partie infrarouge (c'est-à-dire la chaleur) du spectre est dans le temps de l'énergie solaire absorbée dans son atmosphère. Le flux de chaleur d'Uranus est uniquement inférieur au flux de chaleur interne d'environ.

Des fortunes juives majeures ont été fabriquées à Londres, Oxford, Lincoln, Bristol et Norwich. La Couronne, à son tour, a capitalisé sur la prospérité de ses Juifs. En plus de nombreuses taxes arbitraires, Richard I a établi l'ordonnance de la communauté juive en 1194 pour tenter d'organiser la communauté juive. Il a veillé à ce que les dossiers obligatoires soient tenus par des responsables royaux pour toutes les transactions juives. Chaque dette a été enregistrée sur une chirographie pour permettre au roi un accès immédiat et complet à la propriété juive. Richard a également établi un échantillonnier spécial pour recouvrer toute dette impayée due après le décès d'un créancier juif. L'établissement de l'Échiquier des Juifs a finalement effectué toutes les transactions de la communauté juive anglaise responsable de la fiscalité par le roi en plus des 10% de toutes les sommes récupérées par les Juifs à l'aide de tribunaux anglais. Ainsi, alors que les première et deuxième croisades ont augmenté les sentiments anti-juifs, les Juifs en Angleterre sont devenus relativement indemnes au-delà des amendes occasionnelles et des prélèvements spéciaux. Bien qu'ils n'aient pas éprouvé le même type de mobilité sociale et de progrès culturels que les Juifs sous le régime musulman ont fait, les Juifs de la population et de la prospérité de l'Angleterre ont augmenté sous la protection du roi.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When did Jewish people first come to England?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Jewish people first arrived in England in significant numbers in 1066, accompanying William the Conqueror after his Norman invasion and establishment of rule over the country ["}

After the American Civil War, he lived for a time with his family in LaVilla, Florida, helping develop the new town. In 1870, he was one of numerous Southern black migrants to Boston, Massachusetts, which had a thriving black community and strong abolitionist history. He later joined the Republican Party that was founded by abolitionists, and Chappelle was elected to two terms in the Massachusetts state legislature, serving 1883-1886. Julius Caesar Chappelle was also the first African-American to serve on the Massachusetts State Senate Committee where he served three terms. Chappelle was active in supporting civil rights, trying to reduce discrimination, and consumer affairs. His speeches were frequently covered by newspapers. Throughout his life and political career, he held secondary supervisory government positions in maintenance, such as at the United States Post Office and US Boston Custom House. Although Julius Caesar Chappelle may have graced the same pages in newspapers as Frederick Douglass, Chappelle is not as well known because he is not known to have left much of a literary footprint such as writing manuscripts or for pamphlets.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Julius César Chappelle\nContent: Les Chappelle ont été divisés sur la question de l'interdiction, Lewis Chappelle, le frère de Julius C.

Vigilantism arose because territorial law enforcement and the courts had very little power in the remote mining camps during the territorial period.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Vigilants du Montana\nContent: Le premier récit écrit des vigilants a été \"Vigilante of Montana\" de Thomas Dimsdale qui est apparu pour la première fois comme une série d'articles en 1865 des éditions du \"Montana Post\", le premier journal de Virginia City et du Montana. Dimsdale était membre du comité de vigilance Alder Gulch et rédacteur en chef du \"Montana Post\". Ses premiers récits des événements de vigilance Alder Gulch sont largement cités et la version du livre de ses articles, le premier livre publié dans le territoire du Montana en 1866, a été largement réimprimé depuis sa première édition. X. Biedler, l'une des forcements de l'aulne Gulch et Helena, a écrit sur ses activités de vigilance dans ses revues personnelles. Ils n'étaient disponibles que bien après sa mort lorsque Helen F. Sanders, la belle-fille de Wilbur Sanders, les a finalement publiés en 1957. Nathaniel Langford, également membre des justicules, explorateur de l'Upper Yellowstone (1870), premier surintendant du parc national de Yellowstone (1872–1877), collecteur de taxes territoriale (1864–1869) et Publié \"Vigila Jours et pionniers des rochers \"en 1893 après son retour chez lui au Minnesota. Dans un discours de 1912 à la Montana Historical Society, l'historien occidental, Olin Wheeler a fourni des commentaires positifs sur les vigilants Alder Gulch en hommage à la vie de Nathaniel Langford. Un autre récit, non publié avant 1982, est celui de l'ancien juge de la Cour suprême du Montana (1922-1935) Lew L. Callaway. Édité par son fils Lew Callaway Jr., \"Les hausses justes du Montana: les justiciers en action\" découlent de l'association de Callaway avec le capitaine du justicier James William à la fin des années 1800. Lew Callaway a beaucoup écrit sur les justiciers et ses histoires qui ajoutent des détails plus intimes sur la façon dont les justiciers opérés sont capturés dans ce volume. Bien que certaines activités de vigilance au cours de cette période aient été critiquées par les citoyens et les dirigeants civiques, il y a eu une affirmation générale de leur objectif et de leur contribution à la loi et de l'ordre dans un territoire croissant. Marque Les \"Vigilantes du Montana de C. Dillon 1863–1870 Gold, Guns and Gallows\" (2013) concluent que, compte tenu de l'environnement sans loi et de l'activité criminelle dans Alder Gulch et Helena à l'époque, l'absence de tout système de justice fonctionnel était la meilleure pour leurs communautés. Il soutient que juger les justiciers par la compréhension d'aujourd'hui et les normes de procédure régulière est problématique. En 2004, Frederick Allen, journaliste et historien, a publié \"un lynchage décent et ordonné: les justificatifs du Montana\" examinés comme un récit équilibré à jour de l'histoire du vigilance du Montana (1864-1870). Le livre d'Allen renforce les motivations et les méthodes des premiers justiciers dans Alder Gulch tout en commentant le dédain croissant pour le vigilantisme à la fin des années 1860. Plus de généralistes travaille sur l'histoire du Montana tels que \"The Montana Frontier\" de Merrill G. Burlingame (1942) et \"Montana-A History of Two Centuries\" de Michael P. Malone (1991) résument adéquatement la période vigilante en grande partie basée sur des comptes antérieurs de Dimsdale, Langford et Biedler. De plus, de nombreuses histoires d'actualité du Montana, telles que le romancier et l'historien du Montana, Dan Cushman, \"Montana: The Gold Frontier\" (1973) couvrent la période de vigilance.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"When was the Montana Vigilantes formed?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The Montana Vigilantes were formed in 1863, when the mining camps of what was then eastern Idaho Territory lacked effective legal authority ["}

Les lois de la physique sont représentées par des équations simples telles que les lois de Newton, les équations de Maxwell et l'équation de Schrödinger. Ces lois sont comme une base pour fabriquer des modèles mathématiques de situations réelles. De nombreuses situations réelles sont très complexes et donc modélisées approximatives sur un ordinateur, un modèle qui est faisable par calcul à calculer est fabriqué à partir des lois de base ou à partir de modèles approximatifs fabriqués à partir des lois de base. Par exemple, les molécules peuvent être modélisées par des modèles orbitaux moléculaires qui sont des solutions approximatives à l'équation de Schrödinger.

Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65 microteslas (0.25 to 0.65 gauss). Approximately, it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle at the center of the Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. The magnetic field is generated by electric currents due to the motion of convection currents of molten iron in the Earth's outer core driven by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a geodynamo.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Forcer\nContent: où Formula_48 est l'amplitude du courant de test hypothétique et de la formule_49 est la longueur du fil hypothétique à travers lequel le courant de test circule.

Hominidae, including humans and chimpanzees, are also omnivores.\nMost bear species are omnivores, but individual diets can range from almost exclusively herbivorous to almost exclusively carnivorous, depending on what food sources are available locally and seasonally. Polar bears are classified as carnivores, both taxonomically (they are in the order Carnivora), and behaviorally (they subsist on a largely carnivorous diet). Depending on the species of bear, there is generally a preference for one class of food, as plants and animals are digested differently. Wolf subspecies (including wolves, dogs, dingoes, and coyotes) eat some plant matter, but they have a general preference and are evolutionarily geared towards meat.

Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics. Plastics are the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Polymers that have been around, and that are in current widespread use, include carbon-based polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, nylons, polyesters, acrylics, polyurethane, and polycarbonates, and silicon-based silicones.

Inspirés par eux, des méthodes de polymérisation, en utilisant l'ADN ou l'ARN comme modèles pour contrôler les séquences de polymère, sont développés. Au début, en prenant de l'ADN ou de l'ARN comme des modèles, les scientifiques ont développé une série de polymères à base d'acide nucléique peptidique (PNA), sans utiliser d'ADN polymérases. Mais cette méthode est limitée à l'échelle de polymérisation et au rendement. Après cela, la réaction en chaîne par polymérase (PCR) est développée, qui est actuellement la méthode régulée par séquence la plus largement utilisée. En utilisant des enzymes, les rendements et les échelles sont considérablement augmentés, mais la spécificité des enzymes vers les peptides naturels limite cette technique dans une certaine mesure. De nos jours, une plus grande attention est accordée à l'utilisation des ribosomes pour imiter directement le processus de transcription et de traduction. Cette technologie appelée ingénierie des protéines est considérée comme la méthode de polymérisation biologique la plus prometteuse pour la synthèse de polymères contrôlés par séquence.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"What is the most common natural polymer?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: The most common natural polymer is cellulose, the plant-derived polymer that supplies the tensile strength for natural fibers and ropes and has been utilized for centuries in materials such as cloth and cordage ["}

La Nashville School of Law était la YMCA Night Law School jusqu'en novembre 1986, ayant offert des cours de droit depuis 1911 et le diplôme de Juris Doctor depuis janvier 1927. Le YMCA a lancé le concept de la Night School, offrant des opportunités scolaires pour les personnes à temps plein. De nombreux YMCA proposent des programmes ESL, des programmes alternatifs du secondaire, de la garderie et des camps d'été.

Measurement of the cyclic rate assumes that the weapon is being operated as fast as possible and does not consider operator tasks (magazine changes, aiming, etc.). When the trigger is pulled, the rate at which rounds are fired is the cyclic rate. Typical cyclic rates of fire are 600–900 RPM for assault rifles, 1,000-1,100 RPM in some cases, 900-1,200 RPM for submachine guns and machine pistols, and 600-1,500 RPM for machine guns.

Un concurrent de classe mondiale peut tirer et tirer un tir en moins d'une demi-seconde. Étant donné que le temps de réaction humain moyen est d'environ 0,2 à 0,25 seconde, le tour est terminé avant que la plupart des gens puissent réagir. Le temps de réaction des meilleurs tireurs de tirage rapide est de 0,145 seconde, ce qui signifie que le pistolet est armé, dessiné, visé (de la hanche) et tiré dans un peu plus de 0,06 seconde. Pour établir un record mondial de l'association de tirage rapide, un deuxième coup doit être tiré dans la même compétition qui n'est pas plus de 0,30 seconde plus lent que le premier; Ceci est destiné à empêcher un tir qui prévoit que le signal de démarrage de définir un enregistrement.

He also worked on methods of detecting submarines during World War I. He applied for the first patent on a seismic exploration method in 1914, which was issued in 1917. Due to the war, he was unable to follow up on the idea. John Clarence Karcher discovered seismic reflections independently while working for the United States Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) on methods of sound ranging to detect artillery. In discussion with colleagues, the idea developed that these reflections could aid in exploration for petroleum. With several others, many affiliated with the University of Oklahoma, Karcher helped to form the Geological Engineering Company, incorporated in Oklahoma in April, 1920. The first field tests were conducted near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1921.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Sismologie de réflexion\nContent: La sismologie de réflexion (ou réflexion sismique) est une méthode d'exploration géophysique qui utilise les principes de la sismologie pour estimer les propriétés du sous-sol de la Terre à partir d'ondes sismiques réfléchies. La méthode nécessite une source sismique contrôlée d'énergie, telle que la dynamite ou le souffle Tovex, un pistolet à air spécialisé ou un vibrateur sismique, communément connu par le nom de marque Vibroseisis. La sismologie de la réflexion est similaire au sonar et à l'écholocation. Cet article concerne les enquêtes sismiques de surface; Pour les profils sismiques verticaux, voir VSP.\nLes réflexions et les réfractions des ondes sismiques aux interfaces géologiques à l'intérieur de la Terre ont d'abord été observées sur des enregistrements d'ondes sismiques générées par les tremblements de terre. Le modèle de base de l'intérieur profond de la Terre est basé sur les observations des ondes sismiques générées par les tremblements de terre transmises à l'intérieur de la Terre (par exemple, Mohorovičić, 1910). L'utilisation d'ondes sismiques générées par l'homme pour cartographier en détail la géologie des quelques kilomètres supérieurs de la croûte terrestre a suivi peu de temps après et s'est développé principalement en raison de l'entreprise commerciale, en particulier de l'industrie pétrolière.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"Who first developed reflection seismology?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Fessenden is credited as the first developer of reflection seismology, having conceived the idea of using reflected seismic waves to infer subsurface geology, applied for the initial seismic exploration patent in 1914 (issued 1917), and carried out early research on acoustic‐wave propagation following the Titanic disaster of 1912 and during World War I submarine‐detection work ["}

Legend claims that Rugby football was started around the time of 1845 in Rugby School, Rugby, Warwickshire, England, although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times. Rugby eventually split into two sports in 1895 when twenty one clubs split from the original Rugby Football Union, to form the Northern Union (later to be named rugby league in 1922) in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, Northern England over the issue of payment to players, thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay its players, rugby union turned fully professional in 1995. Both sports are run by their respective world governing bodies World Rugby (rugby union) and the Rugby League International Federation (rugby league). Rugby football was one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports. In addition to these two codes, both American and Canadian football evolved from rugby football.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Route de rugby\nContent: Une partie intégrante de Rugby Road est \"Beta Bridge\".

Le pont faisait partie d'un projet de pavage et d'amélioration à l'échelle de la ville pour préparer les rues de la région de Charlottesville pour l'automobile.

En 1971, cet emplacement de fraternité a été fermé et la fraternité Delta Upsilon s'est déplacée vers son emplacement actuel au 180 Rugby Road. Comme les moniteurs non officiels du pont, les frères et les promesses de DU peinaient des messages ou des messages offensants qui ne contenaient pas 'thx du' (pour \"merci delta upsilon\").

Part is a three-times World Champion, having won the 1994 BDO World Darts Championship, and the PDC World Championship in 2003 and 2008. He is statistically North America's greatest darts player to date. He has the distinction of being the first non-UK player to win the World Championship, and the only non-European to date to win the PDC World Darts Championship. His first Championship was the second time a non-seeded player won the BDO World Darts Championship, and one of the few times where a player only lost one set in the entire tournament. His nine year gap between his first and second World Championships is tied with Ted Hankey for the longest gap between World Championships, and his third triumph in 2008 saw him become the first player in history to win a world title in three different venues, and the first to win at the Alexandra Palace. His 2008 win saw him join Phil Taylor, Eric Bristow, Raymond van Barneveld and John Lowe as the only players with three or more World Championships, and become only the second player (after Taylor) to win multiple PDC titles. His eleven televised PDC finals is tied with Dennis Priestley for the eighth most all time, and his £874,151 in prize money to date is the sixteenth highest amount in PDC history.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Jean rouge\nContent: Par l'épisode \"clignotant la lumière rouge\", il est maintenant largement cru que Red John est mort, avec Jane et Lisbonne les seuls conscients qu'il est toujours en vie. L'une des personnes croyant que Red John est morte est James Panzer, un blogueur qui prétend consacrer sa vie à trouver un tueur en série connu sous le nom de \"le tueur de San Joaquin\" (SJK abrégé, qui a tué au moins cinq jeunes femmes). En réalité, Panzer est le tueur. Jane soupçonne Panzer mais n'a pas initialement la preuve de l'exposer. Lorsque lui et Panzer apparaissent tous les deux dans l'émission télévisée de Karen Cross en discutant de l'affaire SJK, Jane reconnaît que Panzer doit être arrêté et engloutit Panzer pour comparer le rouge John défavorablement à SJK. Panzer se lève à l'appât, faisant des déclarations audacieuses selon lesquelles les meurtres de SJK étaient l'œuvre d'un génie et de John John en comparaison est un \"\" sociopathe commun, paresseux, bâclé, délirant \"\" et déjà oublié depuis que Jane l'a tué. Panzer fait ensuite la même erreur commise par Jane et Kristina Frye: dépréciant John John dans un forum public. Quelques heures après l'apparition à la télévision, Panzer est retrouvé assassiné, avec le visage souriant de Red John peint dans du sang sur l'un des murs près de son corps. Le meurtre de Panzer prouve la théorie de Jane selon laquelle Red John est toujours en vie.

Un grand nombre a trouvé leur chemin entre les mains républicaines et nationalistes pendant la guerre civile espagnole. Ils ont été utilisés dans la révolution russe par les bolcheviks et les Russes blancs, et plus tard par les Finlandais contre les Soviétiques.

While the U.S. switchover deadline of 17 February was later pushed back to 12 June 2009 and only applied to American-licensed stations in any case, plans were announced to voluntarily make the station's English-language programming digital-only. The analog signal would be repurposed to retransmit the Mexican Galavisión network (not to be confused with the American cable channel of the same name). Claims on XETV's website that the station was indeed going to transmit a digitally-exclusive signal were rescinded on 17 February 2009 as the station decided to delay cutting off its analog signal until after it secured approval from the Mexican government. XETV management later stated that it had decided to maintain its analog signal to benefit Mexican viewers. XETV's analog signal was eventually repurposed on 5 March 2012, when the station began multicasting on its digital signal with the addition of Televisa's youth-oriented Canal 5 network on subchannel 6.2 and on its analog feed, while digital channel 6.1 retained the newscasts, CW network and syndicated programs in English. On the same date, XHBJ-TV channel 45 dropped Canal 5 for Galavisión. Canal 5 replaced XETV's English-language programming on its analog signal, in order to serve Spanish-speaking viewers in Tijuana that did not have television sets with built-in digital tuners or digital converter boxes prior to the Tijuana market's 2013 transition to digital television. The affiliation switch coincided with the commencement of digital multicasting on Televisa's Tijuana stations.

Consequently, the new carriers never went to sea with a full air group.

The Japanese were left with two choices, either to commit their remaining strength in an all-out offensive, or to sit by while the Americans occupied the Philippines and cut the sea lanes between Japan and vital resources from the Dutch East Indies and Malaya. The plan devised by the Japanese was a final attempt to create a decisive battle by utilizing their last remaining strength, the firepower of its heavy cruisers and battleships, which were to be all committed against the American beachhead at Leyte.

Bilbo Baggins found the Ring and took it for his own, and Gollum afterwards pursued it for the rest of his life.

À la fin de son esprit dans l'obscurité, Bilbo a accepté un jeu d'énigme avec Gollum sur la chance d'être montré en dehors des montagnes. Dans la première édition de \"The Hobbit\", la taille de Gollum n'est pas indiquée. Ce n'est que dans la version révisée, il est spécifié qu'il est petit et est en fait un Hobbit à vie anormalement à longue durée de vie. À l'origine, il était également caractérisé comme étant moins lié à l'anneau que dans les versions ultérieures; Il a proposé de donner l'anneau à Bilbo s'il perdait le jeu de l'énigme, et il a montré à Bilbo la sortie des montagnes après avoir perdu. Pour s'adapter au concept de l'anneau dirigeant qui a émergé lors de l'écriture de \"Le Seigneur des Anneaux\", Tolkien a révisé les éditions ultérieures de \"The Hobbit\": la version de l'histoire donnée dans la première édition est devenue le mensonge que Bilbo a inventé pour justifier sa possession de l'anneau aux nains et au gandalf. Dans la nouvelle version, Gollum a prétendu qu'il montrerait Bilbo la sortie s'il perdait le jeu d'énigme, mais il prévoyait en fait d'utiliser l'anneau pour tuer et manger le hobbit. Découvrant l'anneau manquant, il a soudainement réalisé la réponse à la dernière énigme de Bilbo - \"Qu'est-ce que j'ai dans ma poche?\" - et a volé dans une rage. Bilbo a découvert par inadvertance la puissance de l'invisibilité de l'anneau alors qu'il s'enfuit, lui permettant de suivre Gollum sans être détecté jusqu'à une entrée arrière des grottes. Gollum était convaincu que Bilbo connaissait le chemin du début et espérait l'intercepter près de l'entrée, de peur que les gobelins n'apprécient Bilbo et trouvent l'anneau. Bilbo a d'abord pensé à tuer Gollum pour s'échapper, mais a été submergé par pitié, et donc il a simplement sauté par-dessus. Alors que Bilbo s'échappait, Gollum cria: \"Voleur, voleur, voleur!

Unlike other \"Worst\" series around the world, where being a graduate is rewarded with a new car while the Worst Driver has their car destroyed, \"Canada's Worst Driver\" emphasizes the learning process of the contestants and the science of driving and is often more serious than any other \"Worst Driver\" version around the world, awarding no prizes aside from a trophy at the end of each season for being named the worst (with the exception of season twelve, in which, despite ultimately being named the worst, Krystal McCann wasn't even worthy of being awarded the trophy, leading to Tyler Dupont becoming the first-ever nominee to be awarded the \"Final Graduate\" trophy), as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain, as other versions are mainly comedic. The series is also aired dubbed in French in Canada as \"Les Pires Chauffards Canadiens\" on the Z channel. Until 2011, when \"Canada's Worst Handyman\" was cancelled and later replaced in 2015 with \"Blood, Sweat & Tools,\" \"Canada's Worst Driver\" and \"Canada's Worst Handyman\" were the two highest-rated programs on Discovery Channel Canada.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Le pire conducteur du Canada 12\nContent: Lors de sa dernière réunion avec les experts, Tyler déclare avec confiance qu'il n'est pas le pire conducteur du Canada, tandis que Daniella admet que, malgré s'être amélioré en tant que conducteur, elle se sent toujours beaucoup trop nerveuse pour conduire sur l'autoroute. Krystal, quant à lui, reste provocant jusqu'à la fin. En fin de compte, les experts conviennent qu'il n'y a pas besoin de discussion sur qui est le pire des trois derniers; Alors que Tyler a commis des erreurs majeures sur son dernier trajet et que les pauvres antécédents de Daniella, aux côtés de sa dangereuse indécision sur l'autoroute, l'ont peut-être nommée la pire de nombreuses saisons précédentes, Krystal est acceptée d'être évidemment la pire pour son hostilité et son refus d'apprendre. Andrew, cependant, exprime la déception de ne pas pouvoir atteindre Krystal correctement et estime qu'ils ont échoué en tant qu'enseignants cette saison. Cam, cependant, lui dit de ne pas se sentir de cette façon, lui rappelant, lui et les autres experts, qu'il y en a eu d'autres comme Krystal (faisant allusion à Colin Sheppard de \"le pire conducteur 2\" du Canada et Scott Schurink de \"le pire conducteur du Canada 6\") qui a eu l'occasion de faire un changement, mais n'a jamais pris assez au sérieux.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"How many seasons does Canada's Worst Driver have?\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: Canada's Worst Driver has aired 14 seasons as of December 2018, making it the longest-running series in the international “Worst Driver” franchise ["}
