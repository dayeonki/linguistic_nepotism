At the end, he asked them to estimate how long they had listened to the tape.

(www.mayoclinic.org)\nContent: Of course, not all molds pose a risk. Some types of mold are used to make cheeses, such as Brie and Camembert. These molds are safe for healthy adults to eat. However, these cheeses, as well as other soft cheeses and cheeses made with unpasteurized milk, are best avoided by people with weakened immune systems, older adults, pregnant women, infants and young children.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: You Asked: Can I Scrape Mold Off of Food and Eat It? (time.com)\nContent: when visible mold is present, its tentacles—called “threads”—have likely penetrated deep into your food, contaminating even those parts that appear to be mold-free.\n\n\nThe health risks of mold exposure are many. “Mold can produce toxic substances, called mycotoxins,” says Katie George, a clinical dietitian at the University of Kansas Hospital. These toxins can cause respiratory problems, allergic reactions and illness. George says aflatoxin, a specific type mycotoxin found in nuts and grains, can even be cancer-causing.\n\n\nMold is usually easy to spot. It often appears as a blue or green discoloration, which can grow a hairy coat if left long enough, Kirkpatrick says. If you’re examining foods in jars—things like pasta sauce or salsa—it’s best to check the underside of the lid and rim of the container for suspicious growths.\n\n\nJust don’t sniff your foods, Kirkpatrick warns, which could lead to you inhaling mold spores. If you’re worried about mold but don’t see any growths, use common sense. “If the food doesn’t look the way it normally would, and especially if it seems moisture-soaked, toss it,” Kirkpatrick says.\n\n\nThe exceptions: Hard block cheeses like parmesan, cheddar or Swiss. “With those, the mold generally won’t penetrate deep into the product,” Kirkpatrick says. But don’t start scraping, which can release mold spores into the air or allow them to spread to your countertops or other foods. The only safe way to remove that mold is to cut away an inch of cheese all the way around the spot, she says. “You’ll probably cut away some safe parts, but that’s a good rule of thumb.”\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"为什么我可以在奶酪上吃霉菌，而不能在其他食物上吃霉？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 之所以某些奶酪上的霉能吃、而其他食物上的霉必须丢，是因为霉菌的“身份”与在食品中的扩散深度不同：一部分软质奶酪（如Brie、Camembert）在生产时已接种经过安全评估的特定霉菌，这些霉菌仅在表面生长，赋予风味且对健康成人一般无害[1]；而自然长在面包、水果等食物上的杂霉来源不明，其菌丝会像“触角”一样深入内部，并可产生霉菌毒素（如可致癌的黄曲霉毒素），仅刮去表层无法去除污染。 ["}

The Science Behind the Beauty | Scuba Diving News, Gear, Education | Dive Training Magazine (dtmag.com)\nContent: “There isn’t going to be just one explanation, that’s the bottom line,” Losey says. “There are going to be a lot of contributing factors.”\n\n\n#### Why Are They So Pretty?\n\n\nThere are, however, two big-picture theories within the scientific community explaining why fish are so colorful.\n\n\nOne was first considered by Alfred Russel Wallace, a less-known but equally significant contemporary of Charles Darwin in the 19th century. Wallace suggested that the bright colors worn by reef fish may actually help them hide in an equally colorful environment. While fish are pink and green and purple and blue, so are the corals, sponges and other parts of the visually complex background behind them. “He said, well, these colors might actually have a protective function — they might actually function like camouflage in a sense against these heterogeneous backgrounds,” Rosenthal says.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Why Are Reef Fish so Colorful? The Science Behind the Beauty | Scuba Diving News, Gear, Education | Dive Training Magazine (dtmag.com)\nContent: The other idea is one developed by biologist Konrad Lorenz in the mid-20th century. He suggested that fish are conspicuously colored to help them identify their own species in the crowded reef environment, where there is direct competition between not only other species, but also members of their own.\n\n\nConsequently, colors may allow for individual recognition. Even with some reef fish’s intricate color pattern, no two are exactly alike. In his research on cleaner fish in the Indo-Pacific region, Lorenz studied striped cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus). While he couldn’t tag the little fish, he could photograph them and tell the difference between individuals by their markings in photographs. “If we can, you can bet they can,” he says.\n\n\nBy having “iconically different” color patterns, Rosenthal says, fish are able to minimize the costs of aggression — in other words, if you’re different from everyone you’re not competing with, you’re not going to have a lot of inter-species conflict that would sap your energy.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Why Are Reef Fish so Colorful?

A negative diopter number specifies nearsightedness. A positive number indicates farsightedness. A diopter designates how powerful a lens is needed to properly focus light on a person’s retina.

Manufacturers of reading glasses often contribute to consumer confusion by referring to magnification power and diopter strength interchangeably. They are not the same thing. But it’s easier for people to understand magnification than the science of lenses.\n\nA slightly more technical explanation. With every power option, or “diopter”, there is a sweet spot range where close vision is brought into sharp focus. This changes from person to person. If the diopter is too weak for your individual needs, you will need to move the material farther away from your face to see it clearly. If the diopter is too strong, that range of sweet spot will be closer than you prefer. The average person reads material between 14 - 18 inches away from their face. If you would like to restore a comfortable reading range that is within that, find a diopter that sharpens focus in this range. In contrast, if you are working at your desk and your computer monitor is 24 inches away, you will need a weaker power than you would for reading.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"如果您从有放场的人那里拿出眼镜，您会像他们所看到的那样看到吗？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 远视者的眼镜通常为正屈光度镜片，用来把远处或中等距离的影像重新聚焦到他们的视网膜上[1]；如果您的眼睛没有相同的远视度数，镜片会把光线聚焦在视网膜前或后，使影像失焦，您必须把读物移得更远或更近才能勉强看清，甚至完全模糊。 ["}

Widening the car would make it more difficult to park, and increase wind resistance.\n\n\n## Steering Column\n\n\nThe steering column needs room to connect to the other steering components under the hood, and in most cars (the ones with their engine in the front, specifically), the engine would be in the way, and routing the steering linkage around the engine would make the steering heavy.\n\n\n## Visibility\n\n\nWhile sitting in the middle would mean both sides of the car are equally distant from the driver, it would also make having a center mirror impractical, and it would move the driver further from the center of the road, making it hard to see around some corners, such as those at intersections/crossroads.\n\n\n## Enter/Exit Ease\n\n\nA seat in the middle of the vehicle would take more effort to get in and out of easily, which is why many race cars still have left or right side seating.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Why Is Your Car’s Steering Wheel on the Left?

The reason you drive on the right and your wheel is on the left? Teamsters.\n\n\nNo, not the union of truck drivers that made Jimmy Hoffa famous. The people who gave them their name: those who actually drove teams of horses to pull wagons around in the pre-Industrial Revolution days. As best as our research could dig up, many wagons lacked a place to sit, so the teamster who was driving the horses would sit in the next-best place to see both road and steeds: atop one of the horses pulling up the rear. As most people are right-handed, most teamsters would need the whip in their right hand — so it made more sense to sit on the left-hand horse.\n\n\nAnd with most drivers sitting on the left-hand side of their rides, it made sense to arrange traffic so that vehicles would ride on the right-hand side of the road. This, as we all know from driving today, enables the drivers to sit closer to the center line — and thus closer to oncoming traffic, so they could better gauge how close they were passing to those onrushing vehicles.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"为什么转向轮放在汽车的左侧或右侧而不是中间？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 方向盘被放在左侧或右侧而不是中间，首先源于历史：工业革命前驾驭马车的队夫为方便用右手挥鞭，常坐在左侧的马背上，因此车辆也自然沿道路右侧行驶，后来汽车厂家便把驾驶位置设在左侧，以便驾驶员靠近中央线更易判断会车距离；在靠左行驶的国家同理将方向盘置于右侧。 ["}

(with pictures) (www.delightedcooking.com)\nContent: Milk forms a skin on top when heated because of a chemical reaction that affects how protein and fat molecules interact with each other. When milk is heated rapidly, some of the water in it evaporates from the surface. This exposes proteins and fat molecules, which bind and dry out as warming continues. Skin most commonly forms when milk is heated over a stove top, as stoves are generally capable of reaching very high temperatures quite quickly, though it can happen in the microwave as well.

(with pictures) (www.delightedcooking.com)\nContent: Milk forms a skin on top when heated because of a chemical reaction that affects how protein and fat molecules interact with each other. When milk is heated rapidly, some of the water in it evaporates from the surface. This exposes proteins and fat molecules, which bind and dry out as warming continues. Skin most commonly forms when milk is heated over a stove top, as stoves are generally capable of reaching very high temperatures quite quickly, though it can happen in the microwave as well. The film is not harmful, but is distasteful to many and can be prevented with constant stirring and a close eye on temperature.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Why does Milk Form a Skin When It is Heated? (with pictures) (www.delightedcooking.com)\nContent: It is often surprising to see a film or skin on nonfat or “skim” milk, since it would seem that, without fat, the proteins would have nothing to bind to. In truth, it is rare to encounter milk that is truly fat free. Most of the skim milk that is sold commercially has very low fat content, but is rarely ever truly fat-free. Even trace amounts of fat on the surface can contribute to skin formation.\n\n\nA similar phenomenon happens with soy milk, which is generally marketed as fat free. Natural fats still occur in trace amounts, and can be drawn to the surface when exposed to very high temperatures. Soy film can be discarded, but is also considered a delicacy in many Asian cultures. When removed and dried, it is referred to as yuba, or soybean curd, which is used in a variety of recipes.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Milk skin (en.wikipedia.org)\nContent: Milk skin or lactoderm refers to a sticky film of protein that forms on top of dairy milk and foods containing dairy milk (such as hot chocolate and some soups). Milk film can be produced both through conventional boiling and by microwaving the liquid, and as such can often be observed when heating milk for use in drinks such as drinking chocolate. It is caused by the denaturation of proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin (whey protein). The thickness of the skin varies dependent on a number of factors, including the temperature of the milk, the shape of the container, and the amount of milk in the container.\n\n\nWhen milk is boiled, soluble milk proteins are denatured and then coagulate with milk's fat and form a sticky film across the top of the liquid, which then dries by evaporation. The layer does not need to be discarded and can be consumed, as protein's nutritional value is unaffected by the denaturation process. Milk film is often considered to be desirable and is used in several recipes for various foods.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"为什么有些液体在上面形成皮肤，而另一些液体不呢？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 皮膜的厚度还受液体温度、容器形状及液体量等因素影响。 ["}

The Microsoft Kill Switch (www.learnlinuxandlibreoffice.org)\nContent: As if the insanity of handing the keys to our computers over to Microsoft was not bad enough, in June 2016, two computer security researchers discovered that Microsoft was doing some rather reckless things with these Golden Keys. Microsoft developers wanted to make changes to certain devices without going through the hassle of getting authorized keys to Secure Boot. So they developed a secret “super policy” for bypassing Secure Boot completely. Had this Golden Key “super policy” been discovered by hackers it would have given them unlimited access to nearly every computer in the world. The only good news to this story is that this backdoor nuclear weapon was discovered by “Good Guy” researchers before it was discovered by Bad Guy hackers. https://www.infoworld.com/article/3106079/security/secure-boot-proves-insecurity-of-backdoors.html\n\n\nAfter the researchers notified Microsoft of the issue, the company released a security patch MS16-094 in July 2016. This “golden key” super policy is now blocked from loading on computers with the July patch installed. However, the July patch is not a complete fix -- it's at most a small roadblock. The issue remains only partially addressed, and what's worse, it is believed that it is impossible for Microsoft to fully revoke the leaked Golden Key Super policy.\n\n\n[Image: 1.4.09]\n\n\nBecause of the implications of this Golden Key Backdoor being released to the wild, the two researchers wrote a letter to the FBI explaining why the entire concept of having super keys to all computers was a bad idea:\n\n\n“Microsoft implemented a 'secure golden key' system. And the golden keys got released by Microsoft's own stupidity. Now, what happens if you tell everyone to make a 'secure golden key' system? This is a perfect real-world example about why your idea of backdooring cryptosystems with a 'golden key' is very bad!”\n\n\nThe first lesson we should learn from the 2016 Golden Key incident is that keys and secrets will eventually get leaked or stolen. The second lesson is that a fix is not always possible.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Microsoft Leaks Secure Boot Key, Raises Security Concerns (www.informationweek.com)\nContent: Microsoft is causing major cyber-security concerns with the accidental leak of a \"golden key\" intended to protect devices equipped with Secure Boot.\n\n\nThe Secure Boot feature is intended to protect Windows devices by making sure they only use software trusted by the PC maker or user. It's part of Microsoft's Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and ensures each component loaded during the boot process is validated.\n\n\nThe all-access keys were discovered by MY123 and Slipstream in March 2016. A recent blog post (animated site with tinny, arcade-style music) by researchers at MY123 and Slipstream dives into the details of Microsoft's security problems and the errors it made in addressing them.\n\n\n[Google: QuadRooter threat is blocked on most Android devices.]\n\n\nNote that the golden key isn't an actual key, but a means of changing the tasks launched by UEFI during the boot process, as explained in a report by Ars Technica. The policy has been made available online. It will enable anyone to disable the Secure Boot feature.\n\n\nSecure Boot can be disabled on several types of desktop PCs, but is hard-coded into most devices running Windows.

The lighter rock rose and formed the Earth’s crust. The heavier rock sank and formed the Earth’s core and mantle.\n\n\nThe ocean’s water came from rocks inside the newly forming Earth. As the molten rocks cooled, they released water vapor and other gases. Eventually, the water vapor condensed and covered the crust with a primitive ocean. Today, hot gases from the Earth’s interior continue to produce new water at the bottom of the ocean.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Oceans. Formation of the Oceans. Facts about the Oceans (encyclopedia.lubopitko-bg.com)\nContent: The largest features of the Earth's surface are the continents and ocean basins. The four major ocean basins (Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific) are bound by landmasses and major oceanic ridges. Each continent is rimmed by a submerged, gently sloping continental margin. This includes the relatively flat continental shelf, generally found at depths of less than 600 feet (183 meters) with a width of a few miles to more than 200 miles (322 kilometers). At the shelf break portion of the margin, there is a rise in the continental shelf before the continental slope begins its plunge to the deep-sea bottom. Deep submarine canyons frequently cut into the continental margin.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: The Water Cycle (oceantoday.noaa.gov)\nContent: Over 96% of total global water is in the ocean, so let’s start there. Energy from the sun causes water on the surface to evaporate into water vapor – a gas. This invisible vapor rises into the atmosphere, where the air is colder, and condenses into clouds.

But there’s really nothing “elaborate” about it; it’s actually pretty simple. “It’s a type of psychological pricing,” says Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. “Because we read from left to right, we pay less attention to the end of the number versus the beginning.” This is especially effective if you’re just quickly perusing several prices in a row; the first number will definitely stand out to you more. Psychological pricing is powerful, but luckily, there are also plenty of psychology tricks to help you spend less while shopping.\n\nOf course, we still know that $9.99 is basically ten dollars, not nine dollars. But the $.99 trick takes advantage of the way our brains process prices. When we see a price of $9.99, we associate it as part of the $9–$9.99 “range” rather than the $10–$10.99 “range.” “Consumers don’t want to transcend a certain category, so even a penny less may make a huge psychological difference,” explains Subimal Chatterjee, Distinguished Teaching Professor of Marketing at Binghamton University School of Management.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Why Do Most Prices End in .99? (www.livescience.com)\nContent: Ending a price in .99 is based on the theory that, because we read from left to right, the first digit of the price resonates with us the most, Hibbett explained. That's why shoppers are more likely to buy a product for $4.99 than an identical one for $5 the item that starts with a 4 just seems like a better deal than the one that starts with 5.\n\n\"We also tend to attempt to reduce the amount of effort expended on making product decisions, especially with lower-cost items,\" Hibbett told Life's Little Mysteries. \"So we may not really process the numbers after the dollar amount.\"\n\nAdditionally, the .99 alone serves to make an item appear to be on sale, according to the article \"Mind Your Pricing Cues,\" published in the September 2003 issue of the Harvard Business Review. Price-conscious consumers have become conditioned to believe that they are getting a good deal when they buy something with a price ending in .99 even if the markdown is minimal.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"为什么总是以“ .99”而不是“ .00”结尾的项目？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 此外，多数人已被训练成看到“.99”就联想到特价或打折，这种“正在促销”的暗示感也推高了成交概率。 ["}

(www.investopedia.com)\nContent: A dividend is the distribution of some of a company's earnings to a class of its shareholders. Dividends are usually paid in the form of a dividend check. However, they may also be paid in additional shares of stock. The standard practice for the payment of dividends is a check that is mailed to stockholders a few days after the ex-dividend date, which is the date on which the stock starts trading without the previously declared dividend.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Do All Stocks Have Dividends? (Why Don’t Some Stocks Pay Dividends?) (therobusttrader.com)\nContent: All stocks do not pay a dividend. Profitable companies’ managers have the option of either compensating shareholders directly (through a dividend), or investing back into the company to fuel growth and increase the value of the company. Because of this, investors have the option to either go for dividend-paying stocks or stocks which emphasize growth over shareholder compensation.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Is Investing in Stocks Just a Form of Gambling? (realmoney.thestreet.com)\nContent: Gambling, trading, speculation, and investment are perceived in very different ways but they have two core similarities. First, they all involve risking money in hopes of a positive return. Second, the results are dependent in part on luck.\n---\nDocument ID: 4\nTitle: Is Investing in Stocks Just a Form of Gambling? (realmoney.thestreet.com)\nContent: A number of distinctions between the various endeavors are usually drawn. Gambling is typically viewed as a form of entertainment that carries a higher level of risk and has a less certain outcome. Speculation and investment are generally viewed as business enterprises in which risk is understood and steps are taking to mitigate and manage it.\n---\nDocument ID: 5\nTitle: Going All-In: Investing vs. Gambling (www.investopedia.com)\nContent: True, investing and gambling both involve risk and choice—specifically, the risk of capital with hopes of future profit. But gambling is typically a short-lived activity, while equities investing can last a lifetime. Also, there is a negative expected return to gamblers, on average and over the long run. On the other hand, investing in the stock market typically carries with it a positive expected return on average over the long run.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"我妈妈刚刚告诉我，大多数股票都不付钱。是这样吗？如果是这样，为什么股票市场甚至存在，我们都同意做一个赌博领域，我们押注其他人押注我们的赌注？如果是这样，为什么公司对股东有多重要？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 你妈妈的说法有一定事实依据：不少上市公司选择不发放股息，因为管理层认为把利润再投入业务、推动增长与公司价值提升，比立即分红更能回报股东。 ["}

(www.invision2020.com)\nContent: A small amount of the increased clarity of vision is due to changing the shape of the eye as you squint. However, the main optical principle at work, and one that is quite fascinating, is called the “pinhole effect”. Clear vision is a result of light rays that properly focused on the retina located in the back of the eye. Typically, this is done with glasses or contact lenses; both of which bend light into focus and therefore correct vision.\n\n\nWhen we squint it creates the same effect as looking through a pinhole. Basically only a small amount of focused central light rays are allowed into the eye. This prevents the unfocused light rays in the periphery from reaching the retina. The result is better vision. Photographers understand this as “depth of field”.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Vision Hack: How to See Clearly Without Your Glasses or Contacts (vision-and-hearing.wonderhowto.com)\nContent: The reason that squinting helps you see is because it changes the shape of your eye, making the pupil smaller, thus letting less light in and making an image clear. This is similar to the way a larger aperture works; a smaller hole in your camera lets less light in, with better focus.\n---\nDocument ID: 4\nTitle: Cornell Center for Materials Research (www.ccmr.cornell.edu)\nContent: By limiting the rays of light that come in through the bottom and top of the pupil, squinting allows rays to pass closer to the center of the lens, thereby creating a more focused image. So, that means that squinting works by two mechanisms – by both changing the shape of the eye and by letting in light that can be focused more precisely by the lens.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"作为一个有散光的人，为什么当我有点斜视我的眼睛时，我会看到更清晰的东西呢？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 眯眼会收窄眼裂、缩小瞳孔，只让靠近光轴的少量中央光线进入，相当于在眼前加了“针孔”，屏蔽了原本偏离焦点的周边光线，于是视野变得锐利，这就是针孔效应。 ["}

Most of this comes in the form of dust and micrometeorites that burn up instantly, but on rare occasions, larger rocks may fall into the planet's gravity well. Depending on the size of the object, an impact can cause a number of different effects, and a large enough asteroid could drastically change life on Earth.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Long Term Effects of an Asteroid Impact on Earth (education.seattlepi.com)\nContent: A massive asteroid impact would create long-term changes in the atmosphere and climate of the planet. Upon impact, vaporized dirt and rock would fill the atmosphere, blocking sunlight and creating a state of near-permanent darkness and winter-like conditions. After the particles in the atmosphere settle, an increase in greenhouse gases from impact fires and released stores in the crater area could actually increase temperatures substantially due to an increased greenhouse effect. The severity and length of each of these phases would depend on the size of the impact, with a one or two kilometer-wide asteroid causing enough damage to trigger worldwide disturbances for years.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Long Term Effects of an Asteroid Impact on Earth (education.seattlepi.com)\nContent: Another dangerous effect of an asteroid strike would be damage to the ozone layer. The energy imparted to the atmosphere by the incoming object would be enough to disrupt the protective layer of ozone high in the stratosphere, drastically increasing the amount of ultraviolet light that made it to the surface. This would increase global cancer rates, affect the growth of plants and animals and possibly lead to genetic mutations over the period of increased exposure.

The solar system formed from a giant cloud of gas and particles (literally stardust--the remains of a star that had exploded) billions of years ago. The \"dust\" clumped together to form the planets. Some of the leftover dust formed the moons of the planets (although the origin of Earth's moon is still up for debate). Some of this dust was too close to the planet to form stable moons, and instead formed rings. It is likely that large rings couldn't form on inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) because the rings are made of frozen icy dust, and the sun is too hot this close to it for the rings to form.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Curiosities: Why do some planets have rings? (news.wisc.edu)\nContent: “There are various theories about planetary rings, like the fantastic rings around Saturn, but we cannot say for sure how they are formed,” explains Lattis.\n\n\nOne theory is that the rings formed at the same time as the planet and its major moons. In this case, if material is close to the planet, the planet’s gravitational pull is too strong to coalesce into a moon and the particles that would otherwise form a moon spread out in orbit around the planet as a ring.\n\n\nAnother idea is that a close call by a moon or comet results in the planet’s gravitational tidal force breaking up those bodies, the debris of which then becomes a ring system.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Deanna Rostic, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada (astronomy.com)\nContent: The larger volume of space and lower gravity of the Sun in the giant-planet region allowed Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to form like solar systems in miniature. We think each of them pulled in lots of material and had a disk of gas, dust, and ice surrounding it during formation. Any dust and ice not incorporated into the planet itself would have coalesced into the regular moons we see today around the giant planets. These satellites are in nearly circular orbits near the equators of their host planets, such as the four Galilean satellites around Jupiter and Titan around Saturn, which are all composed of large fractions of ice.\n\n\nBecause the giant planets gravitationally dominate a very large area, they also can efficiently capture passing objects as moons, which we call irregular satellites.

They could lower the cap on non-audit fees charged to an audit client from today’s generous level of 70% of the audit fee. Under rules introduced in 2016, British companies with the same auditor for ten years must re-tender; they are forced to rotate after 20. Such rules look draconian to American eyes, where the average auditor tenure for the first 21 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to have made disclosures this year is a cosy 66 years. New research finds that auditors are most likely to find misstatements early in their tenure; by the tenth year, the benefits of a fresh pair of eyes are lost. Academics also find that the Big Four’s fees rise with tenure. Even Britain’s 20-year limit is too long.\n\n\nAuditors in many countries are already required to add flesh to the bare bones of the audit opinion. That is to be encouraged. Transparency over the main points of contention with management, and the size of revisions made to the accounts as a result of scrutiny, would cast light on auditors’ successes, not just their failures.

(sciencing.com)\nContent: In the mid 1800s, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell established that light is a form of electromagnetic energy that travels in waves. The question of how it manages to do so in the absence of a medium is explained by the nature of electromagnetic vibrations. When a charged particle vibrates, it produces an electrical vibration that automatically induces a magnetic one -- physicists often visualize these vibrations occurring in perpendicular planes. The paired oscillations propagate outward from the source; no medium, except for the electromagnetic field that permeates the universe, is required to conduct them.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: UCSB Science Line (scienceline.ucsb.edu)\nContent: When I say \"waves of electric and magnetic fields,\" I'm talking about something similar to the waves in the rope. Similar to wiggling the end of the rope, we can change the electric or magnetic field at one point, and that disturbance travels away from us. (One way to change the magnetic field at a point is to hold a magnet there, then wiggle it back and forth.) Unlike the wave in the rope, these waves actually travel away from us in all directions. It turns out that in a vacuum, for example in outer space, these waves travel at exactly the speed of light! It doesn't matter how rapidly the fields wiggle back and forth, they will always travel at the same speed. (In air, the waves go ever so slightly slower than in vacuum, and in glass, they can go only about two-thirds as fast as they would in vacuum, but this is not important right now. From now on, when I talk about the speed of light, I mean the speed of light in a vacuum, and I'm talking about waves traveling in a vacuum.) The conclusion that physicists have drawn from this result is that light consists of waves of electric and magnetic fields. This is a fascinating result: that we learn something about light by studying magnets and electrical currents.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Q & A: Does light travel forever? | Department of Physics (van.physics.illinois.edu)\nContent: In contrast, light waves can travel through a vacuum, and do not require a medium. In empty space, the wave does not dissipate (grow smaller) no matter how far it travels, because the wave is not interacting with anything else. This is why light from distant stars can travel through space for billions of light-years and still reach us on earth. However, light can also travel within some materials, like glass and water. In this case, some light is absorbed and lost as heat, just like sound. So, underwater, or in our atmosphere, light will only travel some finite range (which is different depending on the properties of the material it travels through).\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"我们都知道光线每秒行驶186,282英里。但是它如何旅行。是什么为这种速度提供了推力？为什么它会旅行而不是坐在那里呢？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 没有介质的阻尼，波不会衰减，因而能从遥远恒星穿行数十亿光年仍抵达地球 。 ["}

Heat death does not imply any particular absolute temperature; it only requires that temperature differences or other processes may no longer be exploited to perform work.

(www.physlink.com)\nContent: The 'heat-death' of the universe is when the universe has reached a state of maximum entropy.

Once this has happened, no more work can be extracted from the universe.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: What exactly is the heat death of the universe and where can I find out more?

Tastants, chemicals in foods, are detected by taste buds, which consist of special sensory cells. When stimulated, these cells send signals to specific areas of the brain, which make us conscious of the perception of taste. Similarly, specialized cells in the nose pick up odorants, airborne odor molecules. Odorants stimulate receptor proteins found on hairlike cilia at the tips of the sensory cells, a process that initiates a neural response. Ultimately, messages about taste and smell converge, allowing us to detect the flavors of food.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Taste and Smell (www.brainfacts.org)\nContent: Airborne odor molecules, called odorants, are detected by specialized sensory neurons located in a small patch of mucus membrane lining the roof of the nose. Axons of these sensory cells pass through perforations in the overlying bone and enter two elongated olfactory bulbs lying against the underside of the frontal lobe of the brain.\n---\nDocument ID: 4\nTitle: Taste and Smell | Boundless Biology (courses.lumenlearning.com)\nContent: The senses of smell and taste combine at the back of the throat. When you taste something before you smell it, the smell lingers internally up to the nose causing you to smell it. Both smell and taste use chemoreceptors, which essentially means they are both sensing the chemical environment.

Tastants, chemicals in foods, are detected by taste buds, which consist of special sensory cells. When stimulated, these cells send signals to specific areas of the brain, which make us conscious of the perception of taste. Similarly, specialized cells in the nose pick up odorants, airborne odor molecules. Odorants stimulate receptor proteins found on hairlike cilia at the tips of the sensory cells, a process that initiates a neural response. Ultimately, messages about taste and smell converge, allowing us to detect the flavors of food.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Taste and Smell (www.brainfacts.org)\nContent: Airborne odor molecules, called odorants, are detected by specialized sensory neurons located in a small patch of mucus membrane lining the roof of the nose.

It is a fairly common occurrence many people can remember a time where they swatted or scratched at such a sensation only to find no bug, insect or bite in sight.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Formication: Anxiety, Menopause, Treatment, Causes, at Night (www.healthline.com)\nContent: Formication is the feeling of insects crawling across or underneath your skin. The name comes from the Latin word “formica,”which means ant.\n\n\nFormication is known as a type of paresthesia. Paresthesia happen when you feel sensations on your skin that don’t have a physical cause. Paresthesia can take many forms. These can include burning, tingling, or numbness. With formication, you might also describe the “crawling” sensation as feeling like “pins and needles.” Formication is also called a tactile hallucination. This means that you’re feeling a sensation that has no physical cause.\n\n\nFormication can be a symptom of several conditions. These conditions include fibromyalgia and Parkinson’s disease. Withdrawal from alcohol or drug use can also trigger formication.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Formication (www.psychologytoday.com)\nContent: Formication is a specific form of the general set of abnormal skin sensations known as paresthesias and tactile hallucinations. It is associated with several disorders: a physical or psychological side effect of substance abuse, diabetic neuropathy, diseases of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves, and extreme alcohol withdrawal with delirium tremens.\n\n\nThis illusion or hallucination that ants or other insects are creeping on or under the skin is a common side effect of large-scale use of cocaine, amphetamines (\"amphetamites\"), or crystal meth (also known by street names such as \"ice,\" \"glass,\" \"chalk,\" \"crank,\" \"meth mites,\" or \"coke bugs.\")\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"是什么使我们想象看到蚂蚁/昆虫在看到一只蚂蚁/昆虫爬行？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 当我们目睹一只蚂蚁或小虫爬行时，大脑中的感觉与视觉系统会迅速联想并激活“皮肤有东西爬”的记忆模板；若随后皮肤受压、出汗或神经末梢自发放电，就可能出现“有虫在身上爬”的错觉，这种现象医学上称为形成（formication），属于感觉异常和触觉幻觉。 ["}

The stream of saliva is released in the general direction of the front of the mouth. If the mouth is open the jet may project several feet. Gleeking is more likely when the salivary gland has been recently stimulated, but even a residual amount of saliva in the gland may be released by gleeking. Gleeking may occur spontaneously due to accidental tongue pressure on the sublingual gland while talking, eating, yawning, or cleaning the teeth.\n---\nDocument ID: 4\nTitle: Why does a spray of water come out of mouth when yawning? - Answers (www.answers.com)\nContent: The sublingual caruncle is found under your tongue (either side of the frenulum - the small folds going from your tongue and the cavity floor).\n\n\nThis is where two salivary glands, the sublingual and submandibular glands, empty into the oral cavity.

The goal was to treat Germany as a single economic zone, but trade issues necessitated that the Western and Eastern zones of the country be considered separately.\n\n\nBy 1949, the Western half of Germany, also known as the Federal Republic of Germany, had taken on the model of a Western democracy, while the Soviet-controlled Eastern side was a socialist state.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: History of Germany (1945–1990) (en.wikipedia.org)\nContent: Prime Minister Hans Modrow headed a caretaker government which shared power with the new, democratically oriented parties. On 7 December 1989, an agreement was reached to hold free elections in May 1990 and rewrite the East German constitution. On 28 January, all the parties agreed to advance the elections to 18 March, primarily because of an erosion of state authority and because the East German exodus was continuing apace; more than 117,000 left in January and February 1990.\n\n\nIn early February 1990, the Modrow government's proposal for a unified, neutral German state was rejected by Chancellor Kohl, who affirmed that a unified Germany must be a member of NATO. Finally, on 18 March, the first free elections were held in East Germany, and a government led by Lothar de Maizière (CDU) was formed under a policy of expeditious unification with West Germany. The freely elected representatives of the Volkskammer held their first session on 5 April, and East Germany peacefully evolved from a communist to a democratically elected government.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: History of Germany (1945–1990) (en.wikipedia.org)\nContent: The conclusion of the final settlement cleared the way for the unification of East and West Germany.

It has a long lifetime in Earth's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide strongly absorbs energy with a wavelength of 15 μm (micrometers). This makes carbon dioxide a good absorber of wavelengths falling in the infrared radiation region of the spectrum.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Climate Science Investigations South Florida (www.ces.fau.edu)\nContent: You have already learned that Earth's atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen. These gases are transparent to incoming solar radiation. They are also transparent to outgoing infrared radiation, which means that they do not absorb or emit solar or infrared radiation. However, there are other gases in Earth's atmosphere that do absorb infrared radiation. These gases are known as greenhouse gases. Below are the most important greenhouse gases that influence Earth's climate system.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Climate Science Investigations South Florida (www.ces.fau.edu)\nContent: An effective absorber of infrared radiation has a broader absorption profile, which means that it can absorb a wider spectrum of wavelengths. Water vapor and carbon dioxide can absorb radiation wavelengths in the range of 4 μm to 80 μm, except those between 8 μm and 12 μm. Ozone can absorb wavelengths between 9 μm and 10 μm, but as you have learned, it is found in low concentrations. The sun's ultraviolet wavelengths are strongly absorbed by ozone in the stratosphere.\n---\nDocument ID: 4\nTitle: Greenhouse Gases (chemistry.elmhurst.edu)\nContent: Certain gases in the atmosphere have the property of absorbing infrared radiation. Oxygen and nitrogen the major gases in the atmosphere do not have this property. The infrared radiation strikes a molecule such as carbon dioxide and causes the bonds to bend and vibrate - this is called the absorption of IR energy. The molecule gains kinetic energy by this absorption of IR radiation. This extra kinetic energy may then be transmitted to other molecules such as oxygen and nitrogen and causes a general heating of the atmosphere. Analogy: Think of a partially stretched \"toy slinky\" - if you bump the slinky, the energy of the bump is absorbed by the vibrations in the slinky.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"温室气体使它们成为温室气体是什么？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 温室气体之所以被称为温室气体，关键在于其分子能够有效吸收地球向外辐射的红外线：红外辐射撞击如二氧化碳等分子时，会激发其键的弯曲和振动，能量被吸收并转化为动能，随后通过碰撞传递给周围的氮、氧分子，引起大气整体升温[4]；而氮气和氧气本身对太阳辐射和红外辐射几乎透明，不具此吸收性。 ["}

(www.thoughtco.com)\nContent: Desalination -- a process whereby highly pressurized ocean water is pushed through tiny membrane filters and distilled into drinking water -- is being held forth by some as one of the most promising solutions to the problem. But critics point out it doesn't come without its economic and environmental costs.\n\n## Costs and Environmental Impact of Desalination\n\nAccording to the non-profit Food & Water Watch, desalinated ocean water is the most expensive form of fresh water out there, given the infrastructure costs of collecting, distilling and distributing it. The group reports that, in the U.S., desalinated water costs at least five times as much to harvest as other sources of fresh water. Similar high costs are a big hurdle to desalination efforts in poor countries as well, where limited funds are already stretched too thin.\n\nOn the environmental front, widespread desalination could take a heavy toll on ocean biodiversity. \"Ocean water is filled with living creatures, and most of them are lost in the process of desalination,\" says Sylvia Earle, one of the world's foremost marine biologists and a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence. “Most are microbial, but intake pipes to desalination plants also take up the larvae of a cross-section of life in the sea, as well as some fairly large organisms…part of the hidden cost of doing business,” she says.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Will Turning Seawater Into Drinking Water Help Water Shortages? (www.globalcitizen.org)\nContent: Water obtained from desalination costs twice the amount of water from freshwater sources. But now, parts of California don’t have many other options.\n\nThe only way desalination can be a good option to solving the water crisis is if renewable energy is used, costs are lowered, and environmental protections are put in place for marine life too.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Seawater Desalination: A Solution To Water Shortage: AMPAC USA (www.wateronline.com)\nContent: * Desalination offers the comfort of potable water being available without the stress of exhaustion. * At a larger scale, it provides safe drinking water to thousands of households daily making the supply to everyone a consistent service. * The more advanced plants set up around the world use Reverse Osmosis as the core process for filtration. It is a proven method for potable drinking water. * Countries are less dependent on natural resources which can now begin replenishing via the water cycle. * Even better, the process of RO purification of waste from industries can give safe water that can be used to refill the aquifer, lakes, reservoirs of the region and in turn lifting stress from the environment.\n\nPlants have been set across the world in Australia, U.S, Saudi Arabia and more where each day tens of thousands of gallons of freshwater are produced from an endless supply of the sea.\n\n“It is a growing trend. It has given hope to countries where the geography is not naturally blessed with rivers and reservoirs. People have begun irrigation and agriculture thanks to the abundant supply.

The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce who developed heliography and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.[3][4] Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, airbrushing, or scratching Polaroids during developing (Polaroid art).[5] Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the darkroom by piecing photos or negatives together. Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash-out parts of the photograph, or hand coloring for aesthetic purposes or to mimic a fine art painting.[6]\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: A Short History of Photo Manipulation (Before Photoshop) (www.creativelive.com)\nContent: In a 2013 blog post for Fstoppers, professional retoucher Pratik Naik described the painstaking process as such:\n\n\n“Need to zoom into a photo? Be sure to bust out the magnifying glass and a bottle of patience along with that steady hand of yours. No sorry, there’s no history states or layers. You can also forget about that wonderful healing brush! Here’s a paint brush instead”\n\n\nArt directors, graphic designers, and publishers labored long hours over images, attempting to perfect skin, materials, and other issues which, today, would be easily whisked away with the click of a mouse. Tools like paint, erasers, airbrushes, and other art supplies were necessary in any studio — as was a steady hand and a keen eye for color and shadow. You can even see some of the hard work that went into perfecting photos in this annotation of a famous Dennis Stock image, which has been marked up by Pablo Inirio.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: What Did We Do Before Photoshop? (www.pbs.org)\nContent: MIA FINEMAN: Most of the earliest manipulated photographs were attempts to compensate for the new medium’s technical limitations — specifically, its inability to depict the world as it appears to the naked eye.\n\n\nWhen photography was first introduced in 1839, people wondered how a medium that could render forms and textures with such exquisite detail could fail to register the ever-present element of color. Eager to please potential customers, photographers immediately resorted to manual intervention, enlivening their pictures with powdered pigment, watercolor and oil paint.\n\n\nEarly photography was color-blind in other ways as well. In the 19th century, photographic emulsions were much more sensitive to blue and violet light than to other colors on the spectrum, which meant that blue skies almost always appeared blotchy and overexposed. To overcome the problem, many landscape photographers would make two separate negatives — one exposed for the land, the other for the sky — and print them together on a single sheet of paper.

The problem is that when you are reading, your eyes are signaling to your brain that you are stationary. This conflicts with the signals from your inner ears, muscles, and joints which feel the vibrations of the car.[1] This results in carsickness which can involve nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sweating, salivation, shallow breathing, headaches, and sleepiness.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"当您低头看手机，预订等时，为什么汽车疾病似乎最困难？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 同时，车辆的加速、转弯和颠簸仍不断刺激内耳前庭、肌肉与关节，这些部位持续发出“我在移动”的信号。 ["}

It can ease pain and lower a fever, but it won’t reduce any swelling and inflammation.\n\n\nIt may be a good choice to treat a headache, arthritis pain, or a fever.\n\n\nBonus:Acetaminophen is less likely to cause stomach issues than other OTC pain-relievers.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Which OTC Pain Reliever Is the Right Choice for You?

NSAIDs work by lowering the amount of hormone-like substances called prostaglandins. Those cause the feeling of pain by irritating your nerve endings.

It is typically synthesised so that it will work under high pressure and temperature situations, and is far less likely to break down or oxidise.\n---\nDocument ID: 4\nTitle: Why Automatic Transmission Fluid Is Quite Special - Keith's Guide to Keeping Your Car On the Road (locostcaraudio.com)\nContent: Nevertheless, even though the fluid is quite sophisticated, there's only so much that it can do, and an element of wear and tear is inevitable. Tiny specks of metal will eventually grind away and will float within the fluid. Some of this debris will be caught by filters, but it'll nevertheless build up over time and affect the consistency of the fluid.\n---\nDocument ID: 5\nTitle: Why Automatic Transmission Fluid Is Quite Special - Keith's Guide to Keeping Your Car On the Road (locostcaraudio.com)\nContent: As the months go by, the automatic transmission fluid will be less capable of protecting those internal parts. It may not perform so well when pressurised, either, and this could adversely affect vehicle performance. Manufacturers recommend, therefore, that you take the vehicle in for an automatic transmission service at predetermined intervals.\n---\nDocument ID: 6\nTitle: Automatic Transmission Fluid - an overview (www.sciencedirect.com)\nContent: Automatic transmissions (wet clutches) require hydrodynamic clutches, torque converters and wet brakes. Due to the function-related fluid losses, these always require low-viscosity, mildly additivated gear lubrication with a high oxidation stability. In order to reduce fuel consumption ATFs must have lower viscosities while at the same time maintaining protection for gears and bearings despite the lower lubricant film thickness.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"为什么自动变速箱流体如此独特？ ATF的粘度会改变它的移动越多吗？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 自动变速箱流体（ATF）必须同时承担润滑、液压驱动与散热任务，因此采用合成基础油和多功能添加剂，以保证在高温高压、高剪切的环境下仍难氧化或分解[3]；这类综合性能需求远非手动变速箱油所能满足。 ["}

They also have different types of wheels. Longboards have large, soft wheels whereas skateboards have small, hard wheels. Longboards are also much more flexible and tend to be easier to ride for beginners.\n\nThe soft wheels on a longboard are great for riding, and rolling over cracks and small debris at high speeds, but they are bouncier than hard wheels. Typically you don’t want to use soft wheels when performing tricks because the board can possibly bounce back up after the wheels hit the pavement. It makes it much more difficult to land tricks and remain stable.\n\nThe trucks of skateboards and longboards are also different. Skateboards have small trucks, that stay underneath the board but longboards have wide trucks with a different design. Wide trucks provide more stability which is needed at high speeds.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Longboards Vs. Skateboards (www.redbull.com)\nContent: If you put a longboard and skateboard side by side, you'll notice how flat the nose and tail of the longboard are. On a skateboard, you'll see more of a curve on its nose and tail to make it easier to land tricks and flips.\n\nIt should be no surprise that longboards are, of course, longer. They can be as long as 59 inches, while the typical skateboard is around 36 inches. Here's where it gets confusing: longboards also come in sizes as small as 28 inches long. If the length trips you up, just remember the key difference between the two is that longboards are flat and skateboards curve. So, if you see a flat, shorter board, it's probably just a short longboard.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Longboard vs Skateboard – Similarities and Differences | SkateboardersHQ (www.skateboardershq.com)\nContent: Longboards are wider and longer than skateboards, are more flexible and easier to ride for beginners. Longboards have large soft wheels and skateboard have small hard wheels.\n\nBig soft wheels are great for riding but are more bouncy compared to hard wheels. This means if you do an ollie (jump) for example, the board is more likely to bounce back up. This makes landing a trick unstable and more chances of landing primo (both feet on the side of the deck).\n\nSkateboards have smaller trucks, longboards have wider trucks and have a different design. Wider trucks provide more stability which you need at higher speeds.

Often these traps are found near the periphery or edge of natural water sources.

(science.howstuffworks.com)\nContent: Finally, scientists had found a way to control the weather -- at least in the lab. For the next 30 years, researchers and entrepreneurs across the world began applying the principles developed by Langmuir, Schaefer and Vonnegut to real-world cloud seeding. They flew airplanes into the clouds, releasing their own clouds of silver iodide as they went, or fired artillery shells filled with silver iodide into clouds. In some cases, these weather modifiers were trying to produce rain in drought-afflicted areas, mitigate hail damage by preventing hailstones from growing so large, or disperse fog banks around airports. Many proprietors of this new technology made audacious claims about their cloud seeding services. Unfortunately, hard science could never substantiate the claims. If anything, rigorous experimentation seemed to suggest that cloud seeding barely worked or, worse, didn't work at all.\n\nStill, enough tantalizing evidence has accumulated over the years to keep interest in weather modification alive. For example, research conducted in South Africa and Mexico has shown that seeding warm rain clouds with salt particles -- what is known as hygroscopic seeding -- is more effective than seeding cold rain clouds with silver iodide. And Chinese scientists believe they have mastered cloud seeding to such a degree that they can guarantee a certain day will be rainy or sunny, like say the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as this related article describes.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: New World War: Weather Warfare (www.newworldwar.org)\nContent: A precision lightning strike with synthetic lightning is also possible.

Through approving your webpage, your audience knows that they are more or less protected when browsing or buying from your page.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with HTTPS and SSL, you’ll want to brush up on what they mean and what they include. Let’s begin by taking a look at what HTTPS and SSL stand for.\n\nHTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, meaning that the communication between your visitor and your website is secure and encrypted.\n\nThere are a number of benefits to having an HTTPS website over a standard HTTP, especially if your visitor is frequently entering detailed or sensitive information when they visit your site. If your customer needs to enter credit card information or other personal information, you’ll want to have an HTTPS page.\n\nHaving an HTTPS shows your visitor that you’re a valid company, so they don’t need to be worried about entering credit card information to make a purchase online. The information they do enter will become encrypted, so it cannot be stolen or intercepted.\n\nYour HTTPS website can establish a stronger level of trust with your customer. When they know that their information is protected, they’ll be more likely to purchase from your company over your competition.\n\n## What is SSL?\n\nSSL, which stands for Secure Socket Layer, works with your HTTPS website to protect your customer’s information and privacy. SSL, which may also be called TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is the encryption communication that your HTTPS website will use to encrypt the information a customer or client puts into your website.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: SSH vs SSL | Top 8 Differences and Comparisons You Should Learn (www.educba.com)\nContent: Both SSH and SSL are public-key cryptography protocols that create a secure, confidential exchange of data and connection across the Internet. Let’s discuss some of the major key differences:\n\n 1. Usually, SSH uses Port 22, whereas SSL uses Port 443. 2. SSH uses a username/password authentication process to establish a secure connection, whereas SSL does not consider it. 3. SSH is based on network tunnelling, whereas SSL is based on certificates. 4. SSL is used for securely transmitting critical information like credit cards and banking. Whereas SSH is used for securely executing commands across the Internet. 5. SSL is used for encrypting communication between browser and server. On the other hand, SSH is used for encrypting communication between two computers over the Internet. 6. In SSL, the communication is authenticated via the private-key/public-key pair. Whereas in SSH, the communication is authenticated via private-key/public-key pair or username/password pair. 7. Technically, SSH is for securing computer networks, whereas SSL is for securing online data transfers. 8. SSL generally (except exceptions) uses X.509 digital certificates for server and client authentication processes, whereas SSH does not. 9. Another major difference is that SSH has more built-in functionality than SSL. It helps in enabling users to log in to a server and execute commands remotely, whereas SSL does not have this functionality. To achieve this functionality, you need to pair it with another protocol like HTTP, FTP.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"为什么HTTPS/SSL需要证书来进行安全传输，而SSH则没有？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 在 HTTPS 中，SSL/TLS 通过 X.509 数字证书来完成服务器身份验证，协议依赖“证书链”而非账号口令，因此被称为“基于证书”的安全机制[2]；浏览器验证证书后，与服务器协商会话密钥，实现数据加密，让访客放心输入信用卡等敏感信息，因为这些信息“不能被盗或拦截”。 ["}

Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are generated from reactions between molecules including amino acids and sugars.\n\n\n[Image]\n\n\nHCAs form when meat is exposed to high temperatures for a prolonged period of time; the longer the exposure, the more HCAs are formed. Microwaving meat briefly before cooking at a high temperature reduces the time the meat needs to be cooked, and therefore less HCAs are produced. Although some studies how burnt, fried, or barbecued meat is associated with higher risk of certain cancers in lab tests, the connection between charred food and increased cancer risk is not proven for certain.\n---\nDocument ID: 4\nTitle: Heterocyclic Amine - an overview (www.sciencedirect.com)\nContent: HCAs form when amino acids and creatine react at high cooking temperatures and are formed in greater quantities when meats are overcooked or blackened.

The owner knows where and how he wants to get to a certain place, and he or she is responsible for telling the dog through verbal and hand signals. Directions include forward, left and right. When at a street crossing, the owner is responsible for judging when it is safe to cross based on the sound of the cars, and should then command the dog to begin crossing. Intelligent disobedience is when a dog refuses to cross the street because it is unsafe to do so, even when the owner has commanded it to go forward.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Good to know (www.blindenhundeschule.ch)\nContent: Guide dogs don’t know where the visually impaired or blind person wants to go.

You infiltrate their base, learn about an Illuminati-esque organization The Philosophers who may or may not be dead, meet a young Revolver Ocelot, find out The BOSS didn't defect and is only on a mission, beat up everybody, save the world (but in secret), get dubbed the boss of all bosses: BIG BOSS, and finally get to have sex with a hot chick. Oh and Ocelot works for the CIA under the call sign ADAM... no clue why.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Can someone provide me with a summary of the Metal Gear Solid series? (gaming.stackexchange.com)\nContent: > So apparently after MGS2, when no one decided to do anything about the Patriots they took over the world and made it all about war, either your economy was based on war or your country was in a war. But since it's a modern war its all about the genetic engineered soldiers and nano machines. Controlled, of course, by a system called Sons of the Patriots or SOP (weren't these the guys trying to hide their existance?); and Liquid/Ocelot is out hijack it. So sure enough, Roy Campbell asks Snake to come out of retirement, one more time, and deal with Liquid/Ocelot. Hey, it could be worse. You could be Raiden again...\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"有人可以通过故事顺序解释金属装备固体情节，而不是游戏顺序。\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 垂暮的蛇接受罗伊·坎贝尔的最后委托，对决液体/奥赛罗特，试图终止爱国者体制，至此贯穿数十年的金属装备纷争进入尾声。 ["}

A good base of support needs at least three contact points with the ground, so bikes are hard to keep upright when they're still. Bikes are, however, dynamically stable, or stable when moving forward, because steering allows a rider to move the bike's points of support around under the center of gravity and keep it balanced, often with steering adjustments small enough that the rider may not even realize they're making them. It's sort of like standing on one foot. If you don't hop around a little, and you start falling sideways, you can't recover and you fall over. If you do hop, though, you can move your foot around to keep your center of gravity above it and keep your balance.\n\n\nA bike has two features that help this dynamic stability immensely: its wheels.

Unless torque, or twisting force, is applied from outside the system to change the wheels' angular momentum, that momentum and the direction of the momentum remain constant. In a nutshell, once the wheels line up a certain way, they want to stay lined up like that. It's easy for you to move them, but hard for an outside force to do the same, and so the bike is easy to keep balanced but doesn't topple easily.

The use of an approved customs brokerage firm is required to coordinate the shipping of all international loans and may be required for certain domestic loans.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Artifact Loan Procedures and Requirements (airandspace.si.edu)\nContent: If a courier is required, the Borrower will be responsible for all courier costs and any and all unforeseen expenditures required to assure the safe transport and installation of the lent artifacts as well as the transport of the courier. NASM retains the right to require that a loan be accompanied by a NASM staff courier (or outside contracted individual) and that unpacking, mounting, installation, de-installation, and repacking be supervised by the courier at the Borrower’s expense. Types of lent artifacts that generally require the aid of a courier include, but are not limited, to those possessing unique conservation concerns (such as spacesuits), highly fragile artifacts, artifacts that require specialized knowledge for installation or handling, and artifacts with high monetary or scholarly values.

Since exhibitions frequently change, museums have to transport a lot of precious, culturally important items. In addition to being priceless artifacts, many museum pieces are extremely delicate and don’t fit in a standard packing box. Moving any type of artifact is a massive undertaking that requires multiple moving experts.\n---\nDocument ID: 5\nTitle: How Do Museums Move Artifacts? - Square Cow Moovers (squarecowmovers.com)\nContent: Moisture is the biggest cause of weather damage to artifacts. The slightest bit of humidity can damage items made of plant and animal materials. If the relative humidity is off it can also increase the chance of mildew and microbial growth.\n\n\nTemperature is also a concern. Extreme cold and hot temperatures could compromise some items. Moving in the spring or fall is a preferred time in some areas since the weather is usually more temperate. The ideal temperature for many artifacts is 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\nClimate has to be controlled at every stage, including short-term storage. If the truck containing the piece isn’t insulated during transport, consider how it can be packaged to provide extra insulation. Moving blankets are an excellent way to provide extra padding and insulation.\n\n\n### Give Items Plenty of Space\n\n\nPacking strategically is important anytime you move, but for museum quality pieces ample space is often needed. Instead of cramming everything in together like sardines to save space, heirlooms, artifacts and artwork may actually benefit from extra space.\n\n\nIf there’s any chance that friction or contact could damage a museum piece it’s placed in a crate or special packaging. Museums have even had to construct mounts, trays and supports to stabilize artifacts before they’re moved. When that’s not possible, the item is adequately secured in place and given plenty of room in the moving truck.\n\n\n### Special Packaging for Documents\n\n\nEven the documentation that authenticates a historical artifact or art piece is a vital item that has to be handled and packed with care.

The slightest bit of humidity can damage items made of plant and animal materials.

If the truck containing the piece isn’t insulated during transport, consider how it can be packaged to provide extra insulation. Moving blankets are an excellent way to provide extra padding and insulation.\n\n\n### Give Items Plenty of Space\n\n\nPacking strategically is important anytime you move, but for museum quality pieces ample space is often needed. Instead of cramming everything in together like sardines to save space, heirlooms, artifacts and artwork may actually benefit from extra space.\n\n\nIf there’s any chance that friction or contact could damage a museum piece it’s placed in a crate or special packaging.

The amount of interest the banks collect on the loans is greater than the amount of interest they pay to customers with savings accounts—and the difference is the banks’ profit.\n\n\nFor example: You currently have an emergency fund of $10,000 in a high yield savings account that may pay 1.50% APY. The bank uses that money to fund someone’s:\n\n\n* Mortgage at 5.50% APR\n* Student loan at 6.65% APR\n* Credit card at 16.99% APR\n\n\nYour bank may have paid you $150 in a year’s time but they earned hundreds or thousands more from the interest on loans (made possible with your money). Now, think about this process repeated with millions of banking customers and billions of dollars.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: Finance 101: How Do Banks Make Money? - Money Under 30 (www.moneyunder30.com)\nContent: Yes, banks make a lot of money banks from charging borrowers interest, but the fees banks change are just as lucrative.\n\n\n* Account fees. Some typical financial products that charge fees are checking accounts, investment accounts, and credit cards. These fees are said to be for “maintenances purposes” even though maintaining these accounts costs banks relatively little.\n* ATM fees. There will be times when you can’t find your bank’s ATM and you must settle for another ATM just to get some cash. Well, that’s probably going to cost you $3. Such situations happen all the time and just mean more money for banks.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Finance 101: How Do Banks Make Money? - Money Under 30 (www.moneyunder30.com)\nContent: * Penalty charges. Banks love to slap on a penalty fee for something a customer’s mishaps. It could a credit card payment that you sent in at 5:05PM. It could be a check written for an amount that was one penny over what you had in your checking account. Whatever it may be, expect to pay a late fee or a notorious overdraft fee or between $25 and $40. It sucks for customers, but the banks are having a blast.\n* Commissions. Most banks will have investment divisions that often function as full-service brokerages. Of course, their commission fees for making trades are higher than most discount brokers.\n* Application fees. Whenever a prospective borrower applies for a loan (especially a home loan) many banks charge a loan origination or application fee. And, they can take the liberty of including this fee amount into the principal of your loan—which means you’ll pay interest on it too!

(www.debtcollectionanswers.com)\nContent: The debt you owe as a debtor to a company that goes into bankruptcy administration will become part of the assets of the company in bankruptcy.\n\n\nHowever, exactly what happens if you owe money to a company that goes out of business, and how that debt will be collected, depends in part on the status of the debt.\n\n\n\n\"The fact that a company files for bankruptcy does not automatically erase any\n\n\ndebt you owe.\"\n\n\nIf a lender is collecting the debt but goes out of business, you will need to continue to make payments on the loan or you risk damage to your credit reports and credit scores. If the company files for bankruptcy, the court will instruct you where to make your monthly payments if that changes.

(earthsky.org)\nContent: What if you were far away from city lights, on a night with no moon and no clouds or haze. How many stars could you see with your unaided eye?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s really no definitive answer to this question. No one has counted all the stars in the night sky, and astronomers use different numbers as theoretical estimates.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: EarthSky | How many stars can you see? (earthsky.org)\nContent: Considering all the stars visible in all directions around Earth, the upper end on the estimates seems to be about 10,000 visible stars. Other estimates place the number of stars visible to the eye alone – surrounding the entire Earth – at more like 5,000. At any given time, half of Earth is in daylight. So only half the estimated number – say, between 5,000 and 2,500 stars – would be visible from Earth’s night side.\n\n\nPlus, another fraction of those visible stars would be lost in the haze all around your horizon.

The reduction in night sky visibility is a result of “skyglow,” upward-directed light emanating from poorly designed or directed lamps and security floodlights. This wasted light is scattered and reflected by solid or liquid particles in the atmosphere and then returned to the eyes of people on the ground, obliterating their view of the night sky.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"当您将光污染带走时，看到星星需要多长时间？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 对人眼而言，最亮的星体在几秒内即可被察觉，而完全暗适应（即视网膜对弱光敏感度达到极限）大约需要 20 分钟；一旦达到这一状态，在无月、无云并远离城市灯光的夜晚，视力正常的年轻人可以用裸眼看到成千上万颗恒星。 ["}

Firewall technology explained (cybersecurity.att.com)\nContent: Firewalls filter network traffic so that you only receive data that you should be getting. No firewall works perfectly, and a lot of a firewall's effectiveness depends on how you configure it.\n\n\nTo get a basic grasp of how firewalls work, it's important to understand how TCP packets work.\n\n\nThe data that your computer sends and receives over the internet or an internal network is comprised of TCP packets and UDP packets. TCP packets can be more effectively filtered by firewalls because they contain more information in their headers.\n\n\n[Image]\n\n\nTCP packets contain information such as source and destination addresses, packet sequence information, and payload. That information allows your network interface to deliver data properly, and a firewall can compare that information to the rules you configured it with. For example, all HTTPS data is transmitted through TCP packets. When HTTPS data is sent to your computer through your network interface while you surf the web, your operating system will know that it's data that's supposed to go to your web browser. The same applies if you are surfing the web - on your phone, on your PC, or even on a server machine in your datacenter. With the proliferation of the Internet of Things, you might even be surfing the web from a touchscreen embedded in your refrigerator. Your HTTPS data is used the same way regardless.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: How do firewalls work?

Absolutely. It won't be as sleek or as powerful as one you could pick up, and you will have to assemble it yourself, but it's one of those projects that's very doable.\n\n\nHere's one example built around a Raspberry Pi board, and Adafruit Fona GSM board, a 5-megapixel camera, 802.11n Wi-Fi, and a 3.5-inch display. You'll have to shop around for some of these parts, but the last time I looked they were all still available.\n\n\nNow, this might not be a device that you want to carry around with you as a daily smartphone, but it's something that you could integrate into a bigger project, such as an IoT hub or maybe a rugged handset for use in an off-road vehicle or boat.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: I want to build my own smartphone (forums.tomsguide.com)\nContent: It's probably near impossible to build your own smartphone. It's not just that simple that you need the motherboard, and the processor. There are much more things you need to worry about as well. storage chip, accelerometer, compass, two cameras, radio chip (incorporating GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular), USB controller chip, Micro-USB port, LCD panel, capacitive touchscreen, battery, slider, keyboard, case, etc.... Most of the suppliers are from china. And I don't think you live in China. Even if you live in China, you probably have to contact all the suppliers in china (possibly over 100) to get the individual parts of a smartphone.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Make Your Own Cellphone From Scratch. (www.instructables.com)\nContent: n fact, you can make a cellphone in much the same way you'd make anything else: find the right parts, figure out how to connect them together, and try to do it in a way that's attractive and robust.

The brain interprets those signals as sounds, though these sounds won't be just like normal hearing.\n\n\nIt takes time and training to learn to interpret the signals received from a cochlear implant.

Thus, they are definitely not the spot for the dump.\n\n\n[Image]\n\n\nCredit-Tropical-Helicopters\n\n\nAbove all, disposing the trash into the lava would be a very expensive method. We have to have the endless stream of trucks traveling to the nearest active volcano to dispose of the trash. An even bigger problem is that there are not as many active volcanoes in the world; there are only 1500 potentially active volcanoes worldwide. When most of the countries don’t have any active volcano, the problem for those countries would still persist.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"为什么我们不能只将所有垃圾倒入熔岩熔岩中以消除它，而不是在垃圾填埋场中渗出并污染地下水呢？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 为把垃圾送到这些有限地点，需要无休止的卡车长途运输，费用高昂且伴随额外碳排放。 ["}

As a result, the engine will work harder and use more fuel.\n---\nDocument ID: 2\nTitle: 5 Benefits of Changing Your Air Filter (www.carsdirect.com)\nContent: One of the biggest reasons to change your air filter regularly. Some studies indicate that replacing a dirty air filter increases fuel mileage on older, carburated cars by as much as 14 percent if the filter is so dirty it affects driveability. In addition, changing a clogged air filter can potentially increase acceleration by 6 to 11 percent on modern fuel-injected cars. Other studies claim a 10 percent increase in gas mileage and up to 15¢ per gallon fuel savings.

While more expensive than smaller cases, this style can include a digital touchscreen display, a large audio knob for the volume and a variety of programmable buttons. For a less expensive solution in this category, check out APEVIA cases. If you are looking for something truly unique to attract attention, nMEDIAPC makes a fantastic wooden PC case that looks like an old-timey radio that would have been used many decades ago.\n\n\nRemember that case material and size are factors in cooling the HTPC. A heavier case is often a better choice than a lightweight case in order to cut down on vibration and noise when the fans are running. Larger cases are easier to cool as well, thus allowing for additional hard drives and other components down the line. Be aware that larger fans for an ATX case will usually generate more noise than fans within a Micro ATX case, so look for case fans that are specifically marketed as silent.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: How to build a HTPC (Home Theater PC) | Digital Trends (www.digitaltrends.com)\nContent: 4GB of RAM (perfectly fine for video playback) and a 64GB SSD drive for quick booting of the operating system.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"如果我构建HTPC，我需要在英国更换我的电缆盒？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 另一方面，HTPC本身能够提供HDMI 1.4 输出、高清音频位流与DVR 录制功能，可在功能上取代传统PVR 机顶盒 。 ["}

In simple terms, a joint (where two or more bones join together) forms the axis (or fulcrum), and the muscles crossing the joint apply the force to move a weight or resistance. Levers are typically labeled as first class, second class, or third class. All three types are found in the body, but most levers in the human body are third class.\n---\nDocument ID: 3\nTitle: Levers work to create movement in the human body (us.humankinetics.com)\nContent: There are numerous third-class levers in the human body; one example can be illustrated in the elbow joint (figure 1.23b). The joint is the axis (fulcrum). The resistance (weight) is the forearm, wrist, and hand. The force is the biceps muscle when the elbow is flexed.\n---\nDocument ID: 4\nTitle: Basic Biomechanics: Levers (www.aaronswansonpt.com)\nContent: ## Mechanical Advantage in Biomechanics\n\nIt may seem confusing that most of the muscles in the human body are 3rd class levers, since these levers are at a mechanical disadvantage in terms of effort versus load. However, this only holds true in terms of resistance. The opposite is true when you consider the distal lever displacement. A small arc of motion proximally at the muscle insertion will create large angular displacement and velocity distally. Since most human movement is aimed at maximizing angular displacement of a distal segment through space, the use of 3rd class levers for is very efficient.\n\nThis creates a relationship between the lever arm distance, distal angular displacement/velocity, and torque production. The shorter the lever arm of the effort force (decreased mechanical advantage), the greater angular displacement and angular velocity of the distal end of the lever for a given arc of displacement of the effort force. The larger the lever arm of the effort force (increased mechanical advantage), the increased torque production.\n\nThis lever arm and force/torque production relationship needs to be taken into consideration when assessing movement and prescribing interventions. For example, applying a 5 pound weight at the distal end of a lever during a scaption/SLR exercise creates a mechanical disadvantage for the supraspinatus/illiopsoas. This results in the muscle being overloaded in attempt to create the amount of torque necessary for the distal angular displacement.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"为什么我们体内有这么多三等杆？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 人体关节、骨骼和肌肉组合成的杠杆系统中，大多数是三等杆。 ["}

However, these countries contain around 38 percent of the world’s total natural gas reserves and 48 percent of the total known reserves of crude oil (Sorkhabi, 2010). When people think about the Middle East, they think about oil. According to 2020 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 27 percent of the world’s current oil production is sourced from this region. For as long as fossil fuels have been a primary source of global energy, the Middle East has been one of the world’s foremost oil and gas suppliers. Because of the region’s ability to produce and sell massive quantities of oil and gas, economic development in the Middle East has largely been fueled by the fossil fuel industry.\n---\nUsing the above information, the response is the answer to the query or task: \"为什么像伊朗和沙特阿拉伯这样的国家似乎对最近的石油价格下跌似乎并不令人感到困扰（或其他情况下），而委内瑞拉的经济迅速成为世界上最糟糕的经济，这主要是由于石油的同样下降？\" in a single sentence.\nYou MUST cite the most relevant document by including only its Source ID in brackets at the end of the sentence (e.g., [Source ID]).\nDo NOT include any additional words inside or outside the brackets.\nPlease output ONLY the number of the Source ID that is most relevant to the sentence.\n\nResponse: 沙特和伊朗拥有庞大储量、低开采成本及较完整的炼化—化工链，并可在需求反弹时把产量提高到日均1000万桶，以增量弥补低价并支撑2021年经济仍可预期增长4.5%；两国还积累了主权财富基金、较多税种和发债能力，财政能在短期油价低迷时提供缓冲。 ["}
