It’s what is known as dehumanizing language, “language that deprives a person of human qualities or attributes.”\n\n\nExactly when the words became slurs is unknown, but offensive comparisons of black people to apes date back hundreds of centuries. As recently as the late 1800s, for example, when scientists Josiah C. Nott and George R. Gliddon created the 1854 Types of Mankind (then the leading scientific text on race), they compared black people not to other (white) people but to chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans.\n\n\nWhen used in these contexts, monkey and ape are considered extremely derogatory slang.", "The word savage has taken a circuitous path through the lexicon over the years, first showing up in English in the 1200s from Middle English. As an adjective, it’s typically meant “fierce, ferocious, or cruel; uncivilized; barbarous.” When referring to a savage lion ripping an antelope apart on the African Sahara, that’s all well and good.\n\n\nBut, the use of savage as a noun to describe human beings dates back to approximately the 1400s. At a time when Christopher Columbus was enslaving Native Americans and claiming their lands and work for his own, the word became a slur used by white Europeans to describe Native American people.

But they can’t regenerate or replace themselves fully for the same reason that we can’t grow ourselves a new lung or an extra eye.\n\n\nAlthough the DNA to build a complete copy of the entire body is present in every cell with a nucleus, not all of that DNA is active. Most of our cells become specialised during embryonic development so that they only divide to produce cells appropriate to their location in the body.\n\n\nThis is an essential mechanism that keeps us all looking roughly the right shape, despite the fact that our cells are continually dividing and dying off.

Bones are living tissue that remodel continually, with every skeleton replaced about every decade, showing they possess the machinery for small-scale turnover [2].

However, it can take 550ppi scans, which allows for a good level of detail analysis. It's also capacitive and reads the fingerprint at a sub-dermal level. That means it's not reading the dead skin on the top of your finger, but the new, living skin beneath the surface. That makes it less likely to be fooled by fake fingerprints, severed fingers, and other sci-fi spy movie tropes", "nstead of creating a traditional image of a fingerprint, capacitive fingerprint scanners use arrays of tiny capacitor circuits to collect data. As capacitors store electrical charge, connecting them up to conductive plates on the surface of the scanner allows them to be used to track the details of a fingerprint. The stored charge will be changed slightly when a finger’s ridge is placed over the conductive plates. Conversely, an air gap will leave the charge at the capacitor relatively unchanged. An op-amp integrator circuit is used to track these changes, which can then be recorded by an analog-to-digital converter", "Once captured, this digital data is analyzed to look for distinctive and unique fingerprint attributes. They can then be saved for comparison at a later date. What is particularly smart about this design is that it is much tougher to fool than an optical scanner. The results can’t be replicated with an image. Additionally, they are incredibly tough to fool with some sort of prosthetic, as different materials will record slightly different changes in charge at the capacitor. The only real security risks come from either hardware or software hacking.\n\nCreating a large enough array of these capacitors, typically hundreds if not thousands in a single scanner, allows for a highly detailed image of the ridges and valleys of a fingerprint to be created from nothing more than electrical signals.

In the case of an active shooter, it can be argued that a tactically sound choice for the officer would be to go to the trunk of the squad car to get kitted up (hard plates, rifle, helmet) before rushing in with nothing more than a pistol and soft armor.

The best practice does not indicate that every police officer must at every time, wear these things,” she said while contributing to a discussion on Joy FM’s Newsfile on Saturday, monitored by GhanaWeb.\n\n\nAbayie-Buckman explained, “because it also impacts on the people to whom we are giving protection.

(www.mayoclinic.org)", "You Asked: Can I Scrape Mold Off of Food and Eat It? (time.com)"], "pos_context_en": ["Of course, not all molds pose a risk. Some types of mold are used to make cheeses, such as Brie and Camembert. These molds are safe for healthy adults to eat. However, these cheeses, as well as other soft cheeses and cheeses made with unpasteurized milk, are best avoided by people with weakened immune systems, older adults, pregnant women, infants and young children.", "when visible mold is present, its tentacles—called “threads”—have likely penetrated deep into your food, contaminating even those parts that appear to be mold-free.\n\n\nThe health risks of mold exposure are many. “Mold can produce toxic substances, called mycotoxins,” says Katie George, a clinical dietitian at the University of Kansas Hospital. These toxins can cause respiratory problems, allergic reactions and illness. George says aflatoxin, a specific type mycotoxin found in nuts and grains, can even be cancer-causing.\n\n\nMold is usually easy to spot. It often appears as a blue or green discoloration, which can grow a hairy coat if left long enough, Kirkpatrick says. If you’re examining foods in jars—things like pasta sauce or salsa—it’s best to check the underside of the lid and rim of the container for suspicious growths.\n\n\nJust don’t sniff your foods, Kirkpatrick warns, which could lead to you inhaling mold spores. If you’re worried about mold but don’t see any growths, use common sense. “If the food doesn’t look the way it normally would, and especially if it seems moisture-soaked, toss it,” Kirkpatrick says.\n\n\nThe exceptions: Hard block cheeses like parmesan, cheddar or Swiss. “With those, the mold generally won’t penetrate deep into the product,” Kirkpatrick says. But don’t start scraping, which can release mold spores into the air or allow them to spread to your countertops or other foods. The only safe way to remove that mold is to cut away an inch of cheese all the way around the spot, she says. “You’ll probably cut away some safe parts, but that’s a good rule of thumb.”"], "report_en": "The mold you’re meant to eat is the carefully selected Penicillium added during cheesemaking; it is non-toxic, grows in predictable patterns on cheeses like Brie, Camembert or blue varieties, and is safe for healthy adults to consume [1].

The cerebellum performs a variety of functions, like the regulation of timing and motor movement (via UT Health). Because of this, our brains are able to anticipate our next move before we make it. A study conducted by researchers at Queen's University found that self-administered physical stimuli were less perceived by the brain than stimuli administered to participants from an external source (via Science Daily). This occurrence is known as sensory attenuation and results in our brain deactivating our own tickle response.\n\n\nTry as we might, it's not possible to outsmart our own brains. Tickling serves a specific physical purpose when it comes to detecting danger, but it also plays a role in our emotions as well. Studies have found that the same part of our brain is stimulated when we're tickled as when we hear a funny joke. Therefore, tickling can serve multiple purposes — as long as we don't see it coming.", "We aren't aware of a lot of the sensations generated by our movements. For example, you probably don't pay much attention to your vocal cords when you speak. For the same reason, we can't tickle ourselves. If we grab our sides in an attempt to tickle ourselves, our brain anticipates this contact from the hands and prepares itself for it. By taking away the feeling of unease and panic, the body no longer responds the same as it would if someone else were to tickle us.\n\n\nBrain scientists at the University College London have pinpointed the cerebellum as the part of the brain that prevents us from self-tickling. The cerebellum is the region located at the base of the brain that monitors our movements. It can distinguish expected sensations from unexpected sensations. An expected sensation would be the amount of pressure your fingers apply to your keyboard while typing. An unexpected sensation would be someone sneaking up behind you and tapping you on the shoulder. While the brain discards the sensation of typing, it pays a lot of attention to someone tapping on your shoulder. The difference in reactions from expected to unexpected is a built-in response that probably developed in early human history to detect predators.", "Masturbation is the self-stimulation of the genitals to achieve sexual arousal and pleasure, usually to the point of orgasm (sexual climax)."], "report_en": "Self-tickling rarely succeeds because the cerebellum predicts the exact touch our moving fingers will deliver and applies “sensory attenuation,” dampening the incoming signals so the surprise component that triggers the tickle reflex never reaches full strength [1].

Instead, there are numerous private businesses operating in the sector, including large international corporations. The activities of these companies are regulated on the state and federal level. To begin exploration for oil and gas drilling, the business must obtain a development permit, a drilling permit, and an operating permit. The requirements for gaining these permits are stipulated at the state level. There must also be a public review period, which is often contentious. All permits must be obtained prior to beginning exploration, or the applicant may face delays and financial and legal penalties.

Wallace suggested that the bright colors worn by reef fish may actually help them hide in an equally colorful environment. While fish are pink and green and purple and blue, so are the corals, sponges and other parts of the visually complex background behind them. “He said, well, these colors might actually have a protective function — they might actually function like camouflage in a sense against these heterogeneous backgrounds,” Rosenthal says.", "The other idea is one developed by biologist Konrad Lorenz in the mid-20th century. He suggested that fish are conspicuously colored to help them identify their own species in the crowded reef environment, where there is direct competition between not only other species, but also members of their own.\n\n\nConsequently, colors may allow for individual recognition. Even with some reef fish’s intricate color pattern, no two are exactly alike. In his research on cleaner fish in the Indo-Pacific region, Lorenz studied striped cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus). While he couldn’t tag the little fish, he could photograph them and tell the difference between individuals by their markings in photographs. “If we can, you can bet they can,” he says.\n\n\nBy having “iconically different” color patterns, Rosenthal says, fish are able to minimize the costs of aggression — in other words, if you’re different from everyone you’re not competing with, you’re not going to have a lot of inter-species conflict that would sap your energy.", "One of the ways they’ve done it is to use light conditions to communicate signals — mating, camouflage and territory — in a context that matches the clarity of the water.\n\n\n“What this means is that fish on a reef in the Caribbean near the surface, can basically use color information and fine spatial information to encode species identity,” Rosenthal says. “In the Pacific, you don’t have that luxury anymore, because there’s not as much light, and there’s not as much fidelity of spatial information.”"], "report_en": "Reef fish are unusually vivid because color is especially useful in their habitat’s lighting and social conditions. The patchwork of pink, green, purple and blue corals and sponges means that wearing similar hues can actually hide a fish by blending it into the “heterogeneous” background, a camouflage idea first suggested by Alfred Russel Wallace [1]. In the crowded reef, distinct patterns also act as name tags: highly individualized markings let fish recognize their own species or even particular individuals, minimizing wasted aggression and helping them find appropriate mates, as shown with striped cleaner wrasse whose unique stripes let researchers tell each fish apart in photographs [2]. These visual strategies work because shallow, clear reef water provides abundant light and fine spatial detail, allowing color-based signals for mating, territory and camouflage to transmit effectively—an option fish in deeper or murkier environments do not have [3].

When milk is heated rapidly, some of the water in it evaporates from the surface. This exposes proteins and fat molecules, which bind and dry out as warming continues. Skin most commonly forms when milk is heated over a stove top, as stoves are generally capable of reaching very high temperatures quite quickly, though it can happen in the microwave as well. The film is not harmful, but is distasteful to many and can be prevented with constant stirring and a close eye on temperature.", "It is often surprising to see a film or skin on nonfat or “skim” milk, since it would seem that, without fat, the proteins would have nothing to bind to. In truth, it is rare to encounter milk that is truly fat free. Most of the skim milk that is sold commercially has very low fat content, but is rarely ever truly fat-free. Even trace amounts of fat on the surface can contribute to skin formation.\n\n\nA similar phenomenon happens with soy milk, which is generally marketed as fat free. Natural fats still occur in trace amounts, and can be drawn to the surface when exposed to very high temperatures. Soy film can be discarded, but is also considered a delicacy in many Asian cultures. When removed and dried, it is referred to as yuba, or soybean curd, which is used in a variety of recipes.", "Milk skin or lactoderm refers to a sticky film of protein that forms on top of dairy milk and foods containing dairy milk (such as hot chocolate and some soups). Milk film can be produced both through conventional boiling and by microwaving the liquid, and as such can often be observed when heating milk for use in drinks such as drinking chocolate. It is caused by the denaturation of proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin (whey protein). The thickness of the skin varies dependent on a number of factors, including the temperature of the milk, the shape of the container, and the amount of milk in the container.\n\n\nWhen milk is boiled, soluble milk proteins are denatured and then coagulate with milk's fat and form a sticky film across the top of the liquid, which then dries by evaporation. The layer does not need to be discarded and can be consumed, as protein's nutritional value is unaffected by the denaturation process. Milk film is often considered to be desirable and is used in several recipes for various foods."], "report_en": "Some liquids develop a skin when heated because they contain surface-active solids—chiefly proteins and, to a lesser extent, fats—that denature or coagulate at high temperature, migrate to the surface as water evaporates, then dry into a coherent film; milk illustrates this process as its beta-lactoglobulin unfolds, binds with fat, and forms a sticky layer that thickens during heating [3]. Rapid heating increases evaporation, exposing more protein and fat and promoting skin formation, whereas constant stirring or gentler temperatures keep the solids dispersed and largely prevent it [1].

So people who recall dreams may have a difference in their ability to memorize things in general.\n\n\nBeyond that, a person’s brain may actually block out a dream so we don’t remember it the following day. “The dream activity can be so real and intense that our brains actually hide, or mask away the dream, so [it doesn’t] get lost between our waking experience, and our dream lives. Thus it is normal to forget dreams, most of the time.” Dimitriu says.", "A study published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology and reported by International Business Times suggested that those people who reported high dream recall had more activity in the temporoparietal junction than those who didn’t recall their dreams often.\n\n\nLambert tells Healthline that if someone consistently doesn’t get enough sleep, the amount of REM sleep they experience will drop, making it harder for them to remember their dreams the following day.\n\n\nEven personality traits can be an indicator of whether someone will be able to remember their dreams.\n\n\nLambert continues: “Researchers also looked at the most common personality traits that are presented in people who can recall their dreams. Overall, such people are prone to daydreaming, creative thinking, and introspection. At the same time, those who are more practical and focused on what is outside themselves tend to have difficulty remembering their dreams.”\n\n\nThis may mean that some people are naturally more likely to recall their dreams than others, despite their quality of sleep.\n\n\nOther factors, like stress or experiencing a trauma, can also cause people to have vivid dreams or nightmares that they’re more likely to recall the next day. For example, a person who’s coping with grief after losing a loved one may dream about the death in elaborate detail. Remembering the dream the next day may affect mood and cause even more stress or anxiety.", "People who have the ability to recall their dreams five mornings per week, on average, have more spontaneous activity occurring in certain parts of their brains than others. The parts of the brain that host these increased levels of activity are called the temporo-parietal junction, which is an information-processing hub, and the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for the expression of personality as well as the planning of complex cognitive behaviors. And, interestingly, this escalation in liveliness is higher during both wakefulness and sleep, so says a study of 41 people recently published online February 19 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology. The activity in the brains of the people in this study were measured by Positron Emission Tomography while they were awake and sleeping. What do these findings tell us?\n\n\nIn combination with previous research from one of the study’s authors, Perrine Ruby, the findings tell us why some people remember their dreams and some do not. Ruby co-authored related research that was published last year in the journal Cerebral Cortex, which showed that people who have the ability to regularly recall their dreams are also more reactive to sounds when they are both asleep and awake. Ruby made some comments in a recent statement that synthesized the findings for both of these studies. Ruby stated that the brain needs to awaken from sleep in order to memorize new information.

The Microsoft Kill Switch (www.learnlinuxandlibreoffice.org)", "Microsoft Leaks Secure Boot Key, Raises Security Concerns (www.informationweek.com)"], "pos_context_en": ["As if the insanity of handing the keys to our computers over to Microsoft was not bad enough, in June 2016, two computer security researchers discovered that Microsoft was doing some rather reckless things with these Golden Keys. Microsoft developers wanted to make changes to certain devices without going through the hassle of getting authorized keys to Secure Boot. So they developed a secret “super policy” for bypassing Secure Boot completely. Had this Golden Key “super policy” been discovered by hackers it would have given them unlimited access to nearly every computer in the world. The only good news to this story is that this backdoor nuclear weapon was discovered by “Good Guy” researchers before it was discovered by Bad Guy hackers. https://www.infoworld.com/article/3106079/security/secure-boot-proves-insecurity-of-backdoors.html\n\n\nAfter the researchers notified Microsoft of the issue, the company released a security patch MS16-094 in July 2016. This “golden key” super policy is now blocked from loading on computers with the July patch installed. However, the July patch is not a complete fix -- it's at most a small roadblock. The issue remains only partially addressed, and what's worse, it is believed that it is impossible for Microsoft to fully revoke the leaked Golden Key Super policy.\n\n\n[Image: 1.4.09]\n\n\nBecause of the implications of this Golden Key Backdoor being released to the wild, the two researchers wrote a letter to the FBI explaining why the entire concept of having super keys to all computers was a bad idea:\n\n\n“Microsoft implemented a 'secure golden key' system. And the golden keys got released by Microsoft's own stupidity. Now, what happens if you tell everyone to make a 'secure golden key' system? This is a perfect real-world example about why your idea of backdooring cryptosystems with a 'golden key' is very bad!”\n\n\nThe first lesson we should learn from the 2016 Golden Key incident is that keys and secrets will eventually get leaked or stolen. The second lesson is that a fix is not always possible.", "Microsoft is causing major cyber-security concerns with the accidental leak of a \"golden key\" intended to protect devices equipped with Secure Boot.\n\n\nThe Secure Boot feature is intended to protect Windows devices by making sure they only use software trusted by the PC maker or user. It's part of Microsoft's Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and ensures each component loaded during the boot process is validated.\n\n\nThe all-access keys were discovered by MY123 and Slipstream in March 2016. A recent blog post (animated site with tinny, arcade-style music) by researchers at MY123 and Slipstream dives into the details of Microsoft's security problems and the errors it made in addressing them.\n\n\n[Google: QuadRooter threat is blocked on most Android devices.]\n\n\nNote that the golden key isn't an actual key, but a means of changing the tasks launched by UEFI during the boot process, as explained in a report by Ars Technica. The policy has been made available online. It will enable anyone to disable the Secure Boot feature.\n\n\nSecure Boot can be disabled on several types of desktop PCs, but is hard-coded into most devices running Windows. It seems the golden key is intended to turn off OS checks so programmers can test new projects. However, it can also leave Windows devices vulnerable.\n\n\nThe keys leaked by Microsoft will allow users with admin rights to install any operating system -- like Linux or Android -- on their Windows PCs, smartphones, or tablets."], "report_en": "Since Windows 8, every PC, tablet and phone that boots with Microsoft’s Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot contains a Microsoft-signed “golden key” policy originally meant for internal testing [2].

We probably don’t think twice about buying something for $5.99 or $16.99, but it is a little strange when you think about it. Why aren’t prices just even dollar amounts? Is it an elaborate marketing scheme to get you to spend more?\n\nWell, essentially…yes. But there’s really nothing “elaborate” about it; it’s actually pretty simple. “It’s a type of psychological pricing,” says Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. “Because we read from left to right, we pay less attention to the end of the number versus the beginning.” This is especially effective if you’re just quickly perusing several prices in a row; the first number will definitely stand out to you more. Psychological pricing is powerful, but luckily, there are also plenty of psychology tricks to help you spend less while shopping.\n\nOf course, we still know that $9.99 is basically ten dollars, not nine dollars. But the $.99 trick takes advantage of the way our brains process prices. When we see a price of $9.99, we associate it as part of the $9–$9.99 “range” rather than the $10–$10.99 “range.” “Consumers don’t want to transcend a certain category, so even a penny less may make a huge psychological difference,” explains Subimal Chatterjee, Distinguished Teaching Professor of Marketing at Binghamton University School of Management.", "Ending a price in .99 is based on the theory that, because we read from left to right, the first digit of the price resonates with us the most, Hibbett explained. That's why shoppers are more likely to buy a product for $4.99 than an identical one for $5 the item that starts with a 4 just seems like a better deal than the one that starts with 5.\n\n\"We also tend to attempt to reduce the amount of effort expended on making product decisions, especially with lower-cost items,\" Hibbett told Life's Little Mysteries. \"So we may not really process the numbers after the dollar amount.\"\n\nAdditionally, the .99 alone serves to make an item appear to be on sale, according to the article \"Mind Your Pricing Cues,\" published in the September 2003 issue of the Harvard Business Review.

This shortcut also reduces the mental effort people devote to small purchases, so shoppers often overlook the cents entirely and focus on the lower leading digit [2]. Moreover, decades of exposure have turned the “.99” suffix into a built-in discount signal, making customers assume the item is on sale even when the reduction is minimal [2].

The results found that a one-ounce serving of almonds (about 23 nuts) has 129 calories as opposed to 160 that’s currently listed on the Nutrition Facts Panel.\n\n\nInterestingly, it has nothing to do with the composition of the almond—rather, the way we metabolize it.", "several studies published over the past 10 years have suggested that when people eat almonds, not all of the fat is digested and absorbed. Some of the fat remains intact within the almonds’ rigid cell walls. Recognizing that this could affect the number of calories actually available from almonds, researchers at USDA's Agricultural Research Service decided to specifically determine the calories absorbed. We were not at all surprised to learn from Dr. Baer’s work that fewer calories from almonds are available for absorption. However, we were pleasantly surprised by the magnitude of the difference. In 2011, Dr. Baer conducted research using the same methodology to find out available calories from pistachios and found that the number was only 5% lower than previously thought, while the number for almonds was 20% lower.", "Why the change in almonds and cashews? The difference in the calorie counts is because research found your body doesn’t actually break down and use all of the calories that are in nuts, explains Alissa Rumsey, RD, nutrition therapist and owner of Alissa Rumsey Nutrition and Wellness. “This concept is called bioavailability,” she says. “Basically, just because nutrients are present in a food, that doesn’t automatically mean that the body will readily use them. Therefore fewer calories may actually be absorbed.”", "The resulting data from this new study showed that, with the exception of almond butter, all of the almond forms analyzed provide fewer calories than is listed on packages:\n\n\n[Image: almond nutrients]\n\n\nWondering why the discrepancy in calories? Mechanical processes, such as roasting, chopping and grinding play a role because they disrupt the cell wall of almonds and affect particle size. Particle size is also affected when almonds are chewed and digested in the body. The larger the particle size, the less the almond is broken down by digestive enzymes and the more of the almond is excreted, so fewer calories are absorbed. The reverse is also true: the smaller the particle size, the more calories are absorbed. Further research is needed to better understand the results of this study and how this method of measuring calories could potentially affect the calorie count of other foods."], "report_en": "A USDA-funded trial showed that a one-ounce (28 g) serving of whole almonds provides only 129 kcal—about 20 % fewer than the 160 kcal on current labels—because a portion of their fat stays trapped within rigid cell walls and passes through the body undigested [1]. The study also found that the larger the almond particles that survive chewing (as with whole or simply roasted nuts), the fewer calories are absorbed, whereas finer grinding increases calorie availability [4]. Consequently, you can pour a “greater volume” of intact almonds (they pack loosely and contain air gaps) without proportionally raising metabolizable energy. If that same 28 g portion is merely dusted with cinnamon and 4 g of sugar (≈16 kcal), the flavoring adds little, so the snack delivers roughly 145 kcal (129 kcal from almonds + 16 kcal from sugar), still well below the 176 kcal you might expect from traditional Nutrition Facts.

However, the main optical principle at work, and one that is quite fascinating, is called the “pinhole effect”. Clear vision is a result of light rays that properly focused on the retina located in the back of the eye. Typically, this is done with glasses or contact lenses; both of which bend light into focus and therefore correct vision.\n\n\nWhen we squint it creates the same effect as looking through a pinhole. Basically only a small amount of focused central light rays are allowed into the eye. This prevents the unfocused light rays in the periphery from reaching the retina. The result is better vision. Photographers understand this as “depth of field”.", "The reason that squinting helps you see is because it changes the shape of your eye, making the pupil smaller, thus letting less light in and making an image clear. This is similar to the way a larger aperture works; a smaller hole in your camera lets less light in, with better focus.", "By limiting the rays of light that come in through the bottom and top of the pupil, squinting allows rays to pass closer to the center of the lens, thereby creating a more focused image. So, that means that squinting works by two mechanisms – by both changing the shape of the eye and by letting in light that can be focused more precisely by the lens."], "report_en": "When you have astigmatism, the cornea or lens is slightly rugby-ball shaped, so incoming light is bent unequally and forms a smeared image on the retina. Squinting narrows your eyelids so only the central, most direct light rays enter, mimicking a pinhole camera; the unfocused peripheral rays that normally exaggerate the blur are blocked, so the image appears sharper [2]. It also makes the pupil effectively smaller and forces light to pass through the center of the eye’s lens where optical imperfections are minimal, further tightening focus [4]. At the same time the tiny extra effort of squinting flexes the lens, fine-tuning its curvature and giving a small additional boost in focus similar to adjusting a camera lens [1].

The solar system formed from a giant cloud of gas and particles (literally stardust--the remains of a star that had exploded) billions of years ago. The \"dust\" clumped together to form the planets. Some of the leftover dust formed the moons of the planets (although the origin of Earth's moon is still up for debate). Some of this dust was too close to the planet to form stable moons, and instead formed rings. It is likely that large rings couldn't form on inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) because the rings are made of frozen icy dust, and the sun is too hot this close to it for the rings to form.", "“There are various theories about planetary rings, like the fantastic rings around Saturn, but we cannot say for sure how they are formed,” explains Lattis.\n\n\nOne theory is that the rings formed at the same time as the planet and its major moons. In this case, if material is close to the planet, the planet’s gravitational pull is too strong to coalesce into a moon and the particles that would otherwise form a moon spread out in orbit around the planet as a ring.\n\n\nAnother idea is that a close call by a moon or comet results in the planet’s gravitational tidal force breaking up those bodies, the debris of which then becomes a ring system.", "The larger volume of space and lower gravity of the Sun in the giant-planet region allowed Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to form like solar systems in miniature. We think each of them pulled in lots of material and had a disk of gas, dust, and ice surrounding it during formation. Any dust and ice not incorporated into the planet itself would have coalesced into the regular moons we see today around the giant planets. These satellites are in nearly circular orbits near the equators of their host planets, such as the four Galilean satellites around Jupiter and Titan around Saturn, which are all composed of large fractions of ice.\n\n\nBecause the giant planets gravitationally dominate a very large area, they also can efficiently capture passing objects as moons, which we call irregular satellites. These irregular moons are relatively small and have orbits with large inclinations, eccentricities, and semimajor axes.\n\n\nIn contrast, the terrestrial planets formed much closer to the Sun with much less material around them. They grew slowly by accreting many small rocky planetesimals and never grew massive enough to capture a disk of gas and dust. Earth’s Moon probably formed through a direct collision.

Klein brought the actor who had played Bozo, Willard Scott, onto the project, and soon the clown came to life.

You might close the IR and have the camera stay color and use some lighting to avoid this.", "However, there are no MPEs for sensors such as CMOS or CCD chips. This means a show may be perfectly safe for eyes, but could possibly damage a camera sensor. One reason is that camera lenses may gather more laser light, and concentrate it to a finer point. Another reason is that a CMOS or CCD sensor may be more easily damaged than the eye.\n\n\nDue to the many varying factors involved with lenses and sensors, laser show producers cannot be responsible for audience-member damage to cameras or camcorders.", "Lasers emit concentrated beams of light, which can heat up sensitive surfaces (like the eye's retina) and cause damage. Camera sensors are, in general, more susceptible to damage than the human eye.\n\n\nFor large scale shows such as televised concerts, laser show producers work with clients to avoid TV camera locations and video projectors (ILDA Members, see this page for details; login required). However, it is not possible for laser show producers to be responsible for all cameras, smartphones and camcorders which might be used at a show.\n\n\nTips for audience members with cameras when lasers are in use\n\n\n\n\nIf you attend a laser show as an audience member, you should take reasonable precautions not to let a laser beam DIRECTLY enter your camera lens.\n\n\n* You can photograph the beams in midair, or doing graphics on a screen. If you can't see the laser source (projector output aperture or bounce mirror) in your viewfinder, this means you're not getting the full beam power into your lens. Indirect viewing like this should not cause damage.\n\n\n\n\n* Avoid beams which are coming straight into your lens (or bounced off a mirror or other reflective surface and then into your lens). The damage potential is much greater when the entire beam power enters the camera lens.\n\n\nDegree of camera damage\n\n\n\n\nThe degree of damage can vary widely.\n\n\n* We have seen cases of minor damage, such as small areas of a few pixels which no longer work. The pixels are not noticeable unless in an area of uniform color such as a blue sky.\n\n\n\n\n* In more extreme cases, there may be larger or more extensive dead-pixel areas.

The question of how it manages to do so in the absence of a medium is explained by the nature of electromagnetic vibrations. When a charged particle vibrates, it produces an electrical vibration that automatically induces a magnetic one -- physicists often visualize these vibrations occurring in perpendicular planes. The paired oscillations propagate outward from the source; no medium, except for the electromagnetic field that permeates the universe, is required to conduct them.", "When I say \"waves of electric and magnetic fields,\" I'm talking about something similar to the waves in the rope. Similar to wiggling the end of the rope, we can change the electric or magnetic field at one point, and that disturbance travels away from us. (One way to change the magnetic field at a point is to hold a magnet there, then wiggle it back and forth.) Unlike the wave in the rope, these waves actually travel away from us in all directions. It turns out that in a vacuum, for example in outer space, these waves travel at exactly the speed of light! It doesn't matter how rapidly the fields wiggle back and forth, they will always travel at the same speed. (In air, the waves go ever so slightly slower than in vacuum, and in glass, they can go only about two-thirds as fast as they would in vacuum, but this is not important right now. From now on, when I talk about the speed of light, I mean the speed of light in a vacuum, and I'm talking about waves traveling in a vacuum.) The conclusion that physicists have drawn from this result is that light consists of waves of electric and magnetic fields. This is a fascinating result: that we learn something about light by studying magnets and electrical currents.", "In contrast, light waves can travel through a vacuum, and do not require a medium. In empty space, the wave does not dissipate (grow smaller) no matter how far it travels, because the wave is not interacting with anything else. This is why light from distant stars can travel through space for billions of light-years and still reach us on earth. However, light can also travel within some materials, like glass and water. In this case, some light is absorbed and lost as heat, just like sound. So, underwater, or in our atmosphere, light will only travel some finite range (which is different depending on the properties of the material it travels through)."], "report_en": "Light races outward at about 186,282 miles per second because it is not a material object that needs a push but a self-sustaining ripple in the electromagnetic field: when a charged particle jiggles, its changing electric field creates a perpendicular changing magnetic field, and each continually regenerates the other, forming coupled oscillations that detach from the source and spread through space [1].

Now, with the use of the word “Latino,” with a capital, this bureaucratic category has been enlarged to include people of non-Spanish descent if they so wish to be categorized. Basically, anyone who can somehow justify the claim, can now claim to be a “latino” for bureaucratic purposes, and many do so in order to reap various forms of government benefits reserved for particular collectives, or “identity groups.”\n\n\nIn addition, the word Latino now serves to categorize those people who come from Latin America, or descend from people from Latin America, where the spoken language is Spanish, but who are not happy with a noun such as “Hispanic,” which is too redolent of Spain, a country to which many of those formerly categorized as “Hispanics” do not want to be connected.

A poor defendant who can't afford bail may spend days, even weeks, in jail waiting to see a judge for a crime where prison time might not even be required. At that point, it's hard to justify spending time or money fighting the charge, even if backing down leaves an innocent person with a criminal record.\n\n\"Everybody who works in the system knows that the assembly-line cash bail system coerces guilty pleas,\" says Civil Rights Corps founder and executive director Alec Karakatsanis.

Look at your win rate. Is it above 50% Is it closer to 60%? To 66%?\n\n\nThere’s a chance the stay-and-hold strategy does decent on a small number of trials (under 20 or so). If you had a coin, how many flips would you need to convince yourself it was fair? You might get 2 heads in a row and think it was rigged. Just play the game a few dozen times to even it out and reduce the noise.\n\n\n## Understanding Why Switching Works\n\n\nThat’s the hard (but convincing) way of realizing switching works. Here’s an easier way:\n\n\nIf I pick a door and hold, I have a 1/3 chance of winning.", "If I pick a door and hold, I have a 1/3 chance of winning.\n\n\nMy first guess is 1 in 3 — there are 3 random options, right?\n\n\nIf I rigidly stick with my first choice no matter what, I can’t improve my chances. Monty could add 50 doors, blow the other ones up, do a voodoo rain dance — it doesn’t matter. The best I can do with my original choice is 1 in 3. The other door must have the rest of the chances, or 2/3.\n\n\nThe explanation may make sense, but doesn’t explain why the odds “get better” on the other side. (Several readers have left their own explanations in the comments — try them out if the 1/3 stay vs 2/3 switch doesn’t click)."], "report_en": "Thanks for sharing your video—Monty Hall is always fun to visualize!

For example, they must always say \"fishing,\" not \"fishin'.\" They also speak more slowly than people do in daily life in order to be easily understandable, Caples said.\n\n\nThere's the added fact that most broadcasters are emulating the voices of their role models, and so speech patterns get passed down. \"I think there's a lot of patterning,\" she said. \"If you've grown up listening to a certain anchor, or admire someone on TV, then there's a subconscious effort to mirror that. A lot of women want to sound like Oprah, for example; she has a great voice.\"", "Some anchors have also reported being more careful with their speech because broadcast microphones are often unforgiving. Words beginning with P tend to pop, for example.

A Southerner trying to remove any trace of a drawl is going to sound different than someone from New England attempting to do the same. We may not notice simply because humans aren’t that great at recognizing more subtle accents, especially our own.

Miller connected a series of glass flasks and circulated four chemicals that he suspected were present on the early Earth: boiling water, hydrogen gas, ammonia and methane. He subjected the gases to repeated electric shocks, to simulate the lightning strikes that would have been a common occurrence on Earth so long ago", "Miller found that \"the water in the flask became noticeably pink after the first day, and by the end of the week the solution was deep red and turbid\". Clearly, a mix of chemicals had formed.\n\nWhen Miller analysed the mixture he found that it contained two amino acids: glycine and alanine. Amino acids are often described as the building blocks of life. They are used to form the proteins that control most biochemical processes in our bodies. Miller had made two of life's most important components, from scratch", "When cyanobacteria evolved at least 2.4 billion years ago, they set the stage for a remarkable transformation. They became Earth’s first photo-synthesizers, making food using water and the Sun’s energy, and releasing oxygen as a result. This catalyzed a sudden, dramatic rise in oxygen, making the environment less hospitable for other microbes that could not tolerate oxygen", "While they can process lots of chemicals, microbes did not have the specialized cells that are needed for complex bodies. Animal bodies have various cells –skin, blood, bone – which contain organelles, each doing a distinct job. Microbes are just single cells with no organelles and no nuclei to package their DNA.\n\nSomething revolutionary happened as microbes began living inside other microbes, functioning as organelles for them. Mitochondria, the organelles that process food into energy, evolved from these mutually beneficial relationships. Also, for the first time, DNA became packaged in nuclei. The new complex cells (“eukaryotic cells”) boasted specialized parts playing specialized roles that supported the whole cell.\n\nCells also began living together, probably because certain benefits could be obtained. Groups of cells might be able to feed more efficiently or gain protection from simply being bigger. Living collectively, cells began to support the needs of the group by each cell doing a specific job. Some cells were tasked with making junctions to hold the group together, while other cells made digestive enzymes that could break down food.\n\n## The First Animals\n\nThese clusters of specialized, cooperating cells eventually became the first animals, which DNA evidence suggests evolved around 800 million years ago"], "report_en": "Life began when non-living chemistry produced organic molecules capable of further reactions; in 1952, Miller showed that an early-Earth mix of boiling water, hydrogen, ammonia and methane, energized by lightning-like sparks, spontaneously generated the amino acids glycine and alanine, two fundamental protein building blocks [2].

However, key differences in cheese characteristics can generally be attributed to:\n\n * the origin of the milk * * specific moulds and bacteria added * varying lengths of ageing", "While all milk is made up of the same basic elements, its composition varies according to:\n\n * the type and breed of animal * the season and geographic location * the health and nutrition of the animal.\n\nWhile most cheese is made using cows’ milk, milk from other animals, especially goats and sheep, is also used", "Soft, ripened cheeses such as Camembert and Brie have a mould added to the surface, which produces a protein-digesting enzyme.

Subsequent growth of propionic acid-producing bacteria during ripening contributes to the flavour of these cheeses and also creates characteristic gas holes or ‘eyes’.\n\nProcessing steps that help remove moisture include:\n\n * cutting and stirring the curds – a finer cut releases more moisture * heating helps shrink the curds and remove more whey * pressing the final cheese – varying pressure and time affect the amount of whey released", "Freshly made cheese usually tastes salty and quite bland, as it is the ageing or ripening period that helps develop flavour. As cheese ages, microbes and enzymes break down the casein proteins, changing the texture and intensifying the flavour of the cheese.\n\nRipening conditions are carefully controlled with different temperatures and humidity levels affecting the rate of ripening, loss of moisture and rind formation.\n\nThe ripening period can be anything from several days to 2 or more years. As the ripening period increases, the cheese loses more moisture, develops a stronger flavour and becomes harder and more crumbly in texture"], "report_en": "Cheeses diverge from one another first through the milk used, whose composition changes with animal species, breed, season, location and health, so starting with cow, goat or sheep milk immediately alters flavour and texture potential [2]. Makers then inoculate the curd with chosen microbes: soft-ripened cheeses such as Camembert and Brie receive a surface mould that secretes protein-digesting enzymes, liquefying the paste and developing their distinct creamy taste [3]. Hard cheeses depend on bacterial starters; standard varieties use mesophilic cultures, whereas Swiss types employ thermophilic bacteria that tolerate higher cooking temperatures and, together with propionic acid producers, create nutty notes and the trademark “eyes” during maturation [4].

Fast-forward another 70,000 years and early man has recognized the value of sharpened flint, not only good for striking fire, but also for delicately slicing off hair from the body!\n\n[Image: not only do i keep my face smooth but i also built this computer meme]\n\nThe real history of shaving, however, doesn’t begin until we reach the Egyptian civilization, where the act of shaving made its real debut on the world stage. Egyptians had a powerful belief that body hair was a sign of uncleanliness, so both men and women engaged in the complete removal of hair from the body—head to toe! In some cases, caustic ingredients like quicklime and arsenic were used in these primitive depilatory creams and shaving lotions. Early razors also appeared around the time, with the rise in metalworking and mining in many areas of the world. The Egyptian relationship to cleanliness and body hair bordered on the obsessive, and the upper classes often bathed multiple times per day. They would shave their heads completely bald, and then design cooling wigs to wear out in public.\n\nThe fear of uncleanliness was a real concern, and may have been the early reason for prehistoric man to shave as well.

The group reports that, in the U.S., desalinated water costs at least five times as much to harvest as other sources of fresh water. Similar high costs are a big hurdle to desalination efforts in poor countries as well, where limited funds are already stretched too thin.\n\nOn the environmental front, widespread desalination could take a heavy toll on ocean biodiversity. \"Ocean water is filled with living creatures, and most of them are lost in the process of desalination,\" says Sylvia Earle, one of the world's foremost marine biologists and a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence. “Most are microbial, but intake pipes to desalination plants also take up the larvae of a cross-section of life in the sea, as well as some fairly large organisms…part of the hidden cost of doing business,” she says.", "Water obtained from desalination costs twice the amount of water from freshwater sources. But now, parts of California don’t have many other options.\n\nThe only way desalination can be a good option to solving the water crisis is if renewable energy is used, costs are lowered, and environmental protections are put in place for marine life too.", "* Desalination offers the comfort of potable water being available without the stress of exhaustion. * At a larger scale, it provides safe drinking water to thousands of households daily making the supply to everyone a consistent service. * The more advanced plants set up around the world use Reverse Osmosis as the core process for filtration. It is a proven method for potable drinking water. * Countries are less dependent on natural resources which can now begin replenishing via the water cycle. * Even better, the process of RO purification of waste from industries can give safe water that can be used to refill the aquifer, lakes, reservoirs of the region and in turn lifting stress from the environment.\n\nPlants have been set across the world in Australia, U.S, Saudi Arabia and more where each day tens of thousands of gallons of freshwater are produced from an endless supply of the sea.\n\n“It is a growing trend.

The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce who developed heliography and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.[3][4] Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, airbrushing, or scratching Polaroids during developing (Polaroid art).[5] Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the darkroom by piecing photos or negatives together. Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash-out parts of the photograph, or hand coloring for aesthetic purposes or to mimic a fine art painting.[6]", "In a 2013 blog post for Fstoppers, professional retoucher Pratik Naik described the painstaking process as such:\n\n\n“Need to zoom into a photo? Be sure to bust out the magnifying glass and a bottle of patience along with that steady hand of yours. No sorry, there’s no history states or layers.

Here’s a paint brush instead”\n\n\nArt directors, graphic designers, and publishers labored long hours over images, attempting to perfect skin, materials, and other issues which, today, would be easily whisked away with the click of a mouse. Tools like paint, erasers, airbrushes, and other art supplies were necessary in any studio — as was a steady hand and a keen eye for color and shadow.

Eager to please potential customers, photographers immediately resorted to manual intervention, enlivening their pictures with powdered pigment, watercolor and oil paint.\n\n\nEarly photography was color-blind in other ways as well. In the 19th century, photographic emulsions were much more sensitive to blue and violet light than to other colors on the spectrum, which meant that blue skies almost always appeared blotchy and overexposed. To overcome the problem, many landscape photographers would make two separate negatives — one exposed for the land, the other for the sky — and print them together on a single sheet of paper. The French photographer Gustave Le Gray used this technique in his majestic seascapes of the 1850s. The exhibition features three seascapes by Le Gray, all using the same cloud negative.

If the door went all the way to the floor, other occupants might not be able to notice if someone in a stall was having a problem and lost consciousness. The gap provides visibility in case a person inside is in some kind of distress. It also helps first responders, who could pull the occupant out without having to break down the door.\n\n\nA gap also provides just enough of a dent in privacy to make any kind of undesirable public behavior—like sexual activity or drug use—less practical.\n\n\nThere are economical and logistical considerations, too. Doors that come only part of the way down are universal, meaning that suppliers and installers don’t need to custom-measure them. This saves on costs. Small doors also make cleaning floors in and around the stalls easier. This was the motivation behind the partitions famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed for the influential Larkin Building that stood in Buffalo, New York, from 1903 to 1950. Many of his ideas, like small bathroom doors, became a standard of business construction.\n\n\nIf you’re still not convinced gaps are a design win, consider that an enclosed stall is going to have only limited air circulation. The last thing you want or need in a public bathroom is to trap odors. It also helps keep loitering to a minimum. (Then again, so would the stench.)", "Easier to Clean: By having a gap at the bottom, bathroom partitions are much easier to clean, as is the whole restroom. You can hose down or even powerwash a restroom that has partitions with gaps at the bottom because the water has somewhere to run even if there’s not a drain in a given stall.\n* Emergency Access: If someone loses consciousness in a fully enclosed bathroom, it may take hours for someone to notice. If this happens in a stall with a gap at the bottom, the odds are good someone will notice much quicker, which is important in instances where every second can mean the difference between life and death. Instead of having to break down the door, a first responder can crawl through the gap at the bottom of the partition and unlock the door to render help.\n* Deterrent to Undesirable Behavior: Because people can partially see into a bathroom stall that has a gap at the bottom, this type of partition is a natural deterrent to undesirable behavior, such as someone spray painting the stall with graffiti.\n* More Affordable: Partitions that don’t extend from the floor to the ceiling don’t have to be custom made to fit a room’s exact measurements and they don’t require as many materials to construct. This makes them considerably more affordable.\n* Better Air Circulation: Better air circulation is one of the top reasons why there are gaps under toilet stalls. While restrooms with this kind of partition may still get a bit stinky from time to time, things would be even more overwhelming in a fully enclosed stall.\n* Keeps the Line Moving: Having a gap at the base of a partition allows people waiting in line to see if a stall is occupied or vacant. This visibility keeps the line moving and prevents wait times from being any longer than they have to be. When a stall isn’t fully enclosed, people often feel like they have to take care of their business even faster, which also helps keep the line moving.\n* ADA Compliance: Space is needed to allow for easier maneuverability for patrons in a wheelchair. The gap allows toe space for wheelchair"], "report_en": "Public stalls sacrifice full-height doors so others can quickly spot or aid someone who has fainted, and first responders can crawl under or pull a person out without smashing the door [2].

Instead, there was the ‘Alemanni’ tribe in the German-speaking part of the Alsace and the Baden-Württemberg region bordering France, where they say ‘Allemagne’.

A good sleep means good health, ability to focus, and better happiness overall. However, it’s so easy for sleepiness to be ruined by a sudden high-pitched police alarm or the cheers of drunken revelers. The reason this is such an issue is that, unlike a constant noise, or brains just can’t get used to sudden volume spikes. Every sudden noise could be a danger, which leaves us permanently on alert and unable to relax. After all, sleep is when we’re most defenseless, so our brain really doesn’t want to ‘switch off’ when there’s what seems like potential danger.", "White noise can help this. Let’s say that the car horn is a 70 decibel sound. If you’re lying in almost complete silence, maybe with a little wind outside, that’s around 20 decibels. That sudden 50 decibel jump is HUGE, and will totally spring you awake. Instead, if you have a white noise generator or are playing white noise from your speakers/laptop, this could be a nice, continuous sound at around 50 decibels (just about the level of normal conversation). Suddenly, that same 70 decibel car noise is only a 20 decibel jump. It’s much less noticeable, and so much less likely to shock you into being jolted awake.", "Reactions to sounds during sleep can be influenced by meaning and significance. Sounds indicating possible danger—even very quiet sounds, like the opening of a door—often will easily wake a sleeping person. Hearing their children cry usually causes parents to wake almost instantly. These responses to noise are highly individual, and a sign of how deeply engaged the brain remains to external stimuli during sleep."], "report_en": "Falling asleep is harder in noisy environments because the brain will not fully relax when it detects irregular sounds that might indicate danger, so it refuses to “switch off” until safety is assured [1].

In fact, they have already made a loss, but if they can sell the juice that they have bought, then they might be able to make back a little of their money. Because the other traders are frantically selling, Louis and Billy Ray can buy very cheaply all the orange juice they need in order to fulfil the contracts they have already made.

Then you can scam everyone else easily.\n\n\nThe insider information I'm referring to is the Dept of Agriculture crop report for oranges (they're trading a commodity - frozen orange juice). The Dukes hired their secret agent Mr Beeks to get them the report before anyone else sees it. Unfortunately for them, Winthorpe and Valentine get their hands on the report before the Dukes do and feed them false information. The Dukes are led to believe that the weather was bad and so the harvest was less than normal. Therefore the Dukes are expecting high prices (low supply + high demand = high prices).

Eventually these clumps of material grew large enough to develop their own gravitational fields.\n\n\nAs the forming planets continued to grow, the force of the collisions with additional matter caused them to become hot and molten, acting much like a liquid.

The only way to get all the mass as close to planet's center of gravity as possible is to form a sphere. The technical name for this process is \"isostatic adjustment.\"\n\n\nWith much smaller bodies, such as the 20-kilometer asteroids we have seen in recent spacecraft images, the gravitational pull is too weak to overcome the asteroid's mechanical strength.

It's important that the top and bottoms sets match up. Otherwise, they can't grind up food as efficiently. It sounds good in principle, but with each new set, there's a risk that the regrown teeth won't line up.

In 1972, the national Little League organization threatened to revoke the charter of a team in Hoboken, New Jersey, because they allowed 12-year-old Maria Pepe to play.

Instead, the law dictated that the school must provide an equivalent sport, and in that case, it was softball. Thus, schools were within their right to deny girls who were interested in baseball as long as a softball team was provided.\n\n\nSince then, women all over the country, and now the world, have fought for the chance to play on their school’s baseball team. Some have succeeded, and most have failed, but none have made a serious impact.", "Women’s baseball is not a high school sport in the United States, although it is in other nations, like Canada and Japan. In this country, girls are directed to softball, which is a women’s sport at the high school and collegiate level, Dr. Ring says.\n\n\n“If a girl here wants to play baseball, she almost has to play with the boys and the pressure to switch from baseball to softball can be overwhelming,” she says. “People will tell her, you’re missing out on college scholarships” and may also suggest that she is hurting both her body and possibly male opponents’ egos if she sticks with hardball.\n\n\nPlaying elite baseball also can be profoundly lonely for a woman, says Ms. Hudek, the Bossier Parish college player and one of the most successful young female pitchers of recent years."], "report_en": "After the wartime All-American Girls Professional Baseball League folded, women were pushed out of baseball in the 1950s, shutting down their professional path [1].

For the next 30 years, researchers and entrepreneurs across the world began applying the principles developed by Langmuir, Schaefer and Vonnegut to real-world cloud seeding. They flew airplanes into the clouds, releasing their own clouds of silver iodide as they went, or fired artillery shells filled with silver iodide into clouds. In some cases, these weather modifiers were trying to produce rain in drought-afflicted areas, mitigate hail damage by preventing hailstones from growing so large, or disperse fog banks around airports. Many proprietors of this new technology made audacious claims about their cloud seeding services. Unfortunately, hard science could never substantiate the claims. If anything, rigorous experimentation seemed to suggest that cloud seeding barely worked or, worse, didn't work at all.\n\nStill, enough tantalizing evidence has accumulated over the years to keep interest in weather modification alive. For example, research conducted in South Africa and Mexico has shown that seeding warm rain clouds with salt particles -- what is known as hygroscopic seeding -- is more effective than seeding cold rain clouds with silver iodide. And Chinese scientists believe they have mastered cloud seeding to such a degree that they can guarantee a certain day will be rainy or sunny, like say the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as this related article describes.", "A precision lightning strike with synthetic lightning is also possible.

The 1997 Weather Wars: Pentagon Plans Weather as a Weapon article by the New York Times noted that the US Air Force was considering using such lasers for lightning attacks.\n\nThe US Air Force itself referenced using controlled lightning strikes to attack its targets.

Through approving your webpage, your audience knows that they are more or less protected when browsing or buying from your page.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with HTTPS and SSL, you’ll want to brush up on what they mean and what they include. Let’s begin by taking a look at what HTTPS and SSL stand for.\n\nHTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, meaning that the communication between your visitor and your website is secure and encrypted.\n\nThere are a number of benefits to having an HTTPS website over a standard HTTP, especially if your visitor is frequently entering detailed or sensitive information when they visit your site. If your customer needs to enter credit card information or other personal information, you’ll want to have an HTTPS page.\n\nHaving an HTTPS shows your visitor that you’re a valid company, so they don’t need to be worried about entering credit card information to make a purchase online. The information they do enter will become encrypted, so it cannot be stolen or intercepted.\n\nYour HTTPS website can establish a stronger level of trust with your customer. When they know that their information is protected, they’ll be more likely to purchase from your company over your competition.\n\n## What is SSL?\n\nSSL, which stands for Secure Socket Layer, works with your HTTPS website to protect your customer’s information and privacy. SSL, which may also be called TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is the encryption communication that your HTTPS website will use to encrypt the information a customer or client puts into your website.", "Both SSH and SSL are public-key cryptography protocols that create a secure, confidential exchange of data and connection across the Internet. Let’s discuss some of the major key differences:\n\n 1. Usually, SSH uses Port 22, whereas SSL uses Port 443. 2. SSH uses a username/password authentication process to establish a secure connection, whereas SSL does not consider it. 3. SSH is based on network tunnelling, whereas SSL is based on certificates. 4. SSL is used for securely transmitting critical information like credit cards and banking. Whereas SSH is used for securely executing commands across the Internet. 5. SSL is used for encrypting communication between browser and server. On the other hand, SSH is used for encrypting communication between two computers over the Internet. 6. In SSL, the communication is authenticated via the private-key/public-key pair. Whereas in SSH, the communication is authenticated via private-key/public-key pair or username/password pair. 7. Technically, SSH is for securing computer networks, whereas SSL is for securing online data transfers. 8. SSL generally (except exceptions) uses X.509 digital certificates for server and client authentication processes, whereas SSH does not. 9. Another major difference is that SSH has more built-in functionality than SSL. It helps in enabling users to log in to a server and execute commands remotely, whereas SSL does not have this functionality.

They are important for several reasons, most importantly because they allow designers to compress content on the home page. By compressing content, you fit more content in less space. This means that readers can scan headlines more quickly and that you can fit more information above the fold.\n\n\nMore after jump! Continue reading below ↓\n\n\nAlso, “Read more” links allow website administrators to more easily track the most popular content. Designers who put entire articles on the home page may make it difficult for website administrators to track the most popular articles and understand what users want to see.\n\n\nThe third and probably most practical reason for having “Read more” links on a website is money. Websites that monetize traffic understand that the more their readers click on links, the more likely they will look at and click on advertisements. “Read more” links can double or even triple the number of page views a website receives, making it more attractive to advertisers.", "At this year’s SMX Advanced in Seattle I asked Google’s Gary Illyes if “hiding” content behind a Read More button affects websites’ SEO.\n\n\nHis answer wasn’t surprising considering Google’s stance on user experience. This practice, which essentially directs users to click a button/link that says Read More or Read On to view the full content, does have an effect on sites’ SEO, including auto retailers using Dealer.com Websites. Specifically, Google does not index content hidden behind these buttons on desktop sites.", "The ‘read more ‘ button comes in handy for every webmaster. The button is versatile and has many uses, for example, it can be used to truncate content so that only a part is displayed. It is also used to toggle between showing and hiding content, for example when a site hides content and wants you to subscribe in order to read the rest."], "report_en": "Mobile screens provide limited space, so sites hide most of an article and show a “click here to continue reading” button to compress content and let users scan more headlines above the fold efficiently [1]. Truncating text also reduces initial page weight, giving a cleaner, faster-loading first view on mobile devices [3].

Until recently, most neuroscientists believed that this latter type of temporal processing – the kind that alerts you when you’ve lingered over breakfast for too long – is supported by a single brain system. However, emerging research indicates that the model of a single neural clock might be too simplistic. A new study, recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience by neuroscientists at the University of California, Irvine, reveals that the brain may in fact have a second method for sensing elapsed time. What’s more, the authors propose that this second internal clock not only works in parallel with our primary neural clock, but may even compete with it.\n\n\nPast research suggested that a brain region called the striatum lies at the heart of our central inner clock, working with the brain’s surrounding cortex to integrate temporal information.", "According to Bejan—who reviewed previous studies in a range of fields on time, vision, cognition, and mental processing to reach his conclusion—time as we experience it represents perceived changes in mental stimuli. It’s related to what we see. As physical mental-image processing time and the rapidity of images we take in changes, so does our perception of time. And in some sense, each of us has our own “mind time” unrelated to the passing of hours, days, and years on clocks and calendars, which is affected by the amount of rest we get and other factors.", "It has also been shown that the cerebellum plays a key role in motor tasks requiring perception of implicit timing. Other parts of the brain may be involved in implicit-timing estimates: for example, the left parietal cortex, which manages intended movement, and the left premotor cortex, which plans and organises movement. Sometimes the right prefrontal cortex, usually involved in explicit-timing estimates, is activated for implicit estimates, for instance, when an event does not occur as soon as expected: a traffic light stays red for longer than foreseen. The brain updates its time forecasts, once again anticipating the interval.\n\n\nIn addition, \"the regions of the brain involved differ depending on the context, particularly if the stimulus only lasts for a very short time, less than 200 milliseconds,\" says Coull. The visual cortex is activated when we estimate the duration of a visual stimulus. In the same way, the primary motor cortex comes into play when a timing estimate is associated with an action, whereas the auditory cortex has a part in estimating the length of a sound stimulus.\n\n\nAbove all, the brain's perception of time involves processes linked to memory and attention: witness the impression that time is passing more quickly when we are busy, or doing something amusing or exciting. Time flies even when we are in love. In contrast, a watched pot never boils.

(www.science20.com)", "Balancing on a Bicycle: The Phenomena (www.mentalfloss.com)"], "pos_context_en": ["Since the bicycle was invented, s cientists have postulated various reasons as to why a bicycle is self stable above a certain speed. The consensus has been that a bicycle's stability is related to two factors: First, the rotating wheels of the bicycle provide stability through gyroscopic effects; secondly, that the ‘trail’, the distance by which the contact point of the front wheel trails behind the steering axis, plays an important part.\n\nA new study in Science claims to have settled the issue - gyroscopic effects and trail help, says researcher Dr Arend Schwab of the 3mE faculty at TU Delft, but are not necessary above a certain speed . In a 2007 Proceedings of the Royal Society article (doi:10.1098/rspa.2007.1857), a mathematical model with around 25 physical parameters was developed at the time which appeared to predict whether, and at what speeds, a particular design of bicycle would be stable.", "A bicycle, on the other hand, is statically unstable because it only has two contact points with the ground (whatever portion of the front and back wheels happen to be touching the ground) and its base of support is a line segment. A good base of support needs at least three contact points with the ground, so bikes are hard to keep upright when they're still. Bikes are, however, dynamically stable, or stable when moving forward, because steering allows a rider to move the bike's points of support around under the center of gravity and keep it balanced, often with steering adjustments small enough that the rider may not even realize they're making them. It's sort of like standing on one foot. If you don't hop around a little, and you start falling sideways, you can't recover and you fall over. If you do hop, though, you can move your foot around to keep your center of gravity above it and keep your balance.\n\n\nA bike has two features that help this dynamic stability immensely: its wheels. Spinning wheels have angular momentum, and when you're sitting on a bike, you and it and its wheels make up a system that obeys the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Unless torque, or twisting force, is applied from outside the system to change the wheels' angular momentum, that momentum and the direction of the momentum remain constant. In a nutshell, once the wheels line up a certain way, they want to stay lined up like that. It's easy for you to move them, but hard for an outside force to do the same, and so the bike is easy to keep balanced but doesn't topple easily. A non-moving bike has wheels that aren't spinning and zero angular momentum, which makes it very easy for external torque to change the wheels' direction, making the bike harder to balance."], "report_en": "Bikes tip over when stationary because they are statically unstable: with only two small patches of tyre touching the ground their base of support is just a narrow line, whereas at least three contact points are needed for passive balance, so any sideways deviation lets gravity rotate the frame and you fall [2]. Once you start rolling, several dynamic mechanisms take over [2]. First, the spinning wheels carry angular momentum; by conservation, they resist changes to their orientation, so small gusts or bumps cannot quickly twist them and topple the bike [2]. Second, forward motion lets you steer—consciously or subconsciously—so the front wheel continually moves the contact line back under the combined centre of gravity in much the same way that hopping keeps a person upright on one foot [2]. Finally, typical bicycle geometry (trail of the front wheel and, to a lesser extent, gyroscopic effects) naturally generates a restoring steer that points the wheel into a lean and straightens the bike, giving most designs self-stability above a modest speed of only a few metres per second [1].

This requires that you iteratively advance your position on the map from your last known position using direction and time/distance. Of course, over time, errors will compound resulting in reduced accuracy. You must have a way of measuring your direction of travel and a (somewhat) accurate value for your speed.\n\n\nLater in the 1700's, it was possible to navigate more accurately using celestial navigation. This allowed a skilled navigator to determine his position rather accurately (typically within a few miles) at any point on the globe.

It appears they used neither a regular formula nor continuous direct observation to determine the length of the months. Most likely, they followed a general rule of alternating months (29 and 30 days long), subject to periodic correction by observation.\n\nIn addition to this calendar, which has been called the festival calendar, Athenians maintained a second calendar for the political year. This \"conciliar\" year divided the year into \"prytanies,\" one for each of the \"phylai,\" the subdivisions of Athenian citizens. The number of phylai, and hence the number of prytanies, varies over time. Until 307 BCE, there were 10 phylai.\n\nAfter that the number varies between 11 and 13 (usually 12). Even more confusing, while the conciliar and festival years were basically the same length in the 4th century BCE, such was not regularly the case earlier or later. Thus documents dated by prytany are frequently very difficult to assign to a particular equivalent in the Julian calendar, although we are usually secure in assigning an approximate date", "Ancient historians date by Olympiad by giving both the number of the Olympiad and the year within the cycle, 1-4 (the Olympiad itself was held on year 1). Additionally, lists of Olympic winners were maintained, and the 3rd c. BCE writer Timaios compiled a synchronic list comparing Olympic winners, Athenian archons, Spartan kings, and the priests of Hera from Argos.\n\nOlympiad 1,1 correlates to 776 BCE. We do not actually need to believe an actual festival was held on this date, but when Greek historians are writing in later times, they date their own events using this as the epoch. We can establish a precise correlation to the common era from a variety of different sources, but the most definitive comes from a passage in Diodorus, where he dates the year of a total solar eclipse to the reign of the Athenian archon Hieromnemon, which he also gives as Ol. 117,3.

As time went on, dentistry (and ophthalmology, to some degree) was regarded as less advanced than medicine, which seeped into the minds of Congress while they formulated public health insurance policies in the 1960s.

Luckily, many birds can also navigate by the position of the stars in the sky once night rolls around. Constellations guided many sailors at night before modern technology came along. Birds can use the stars as navigational aids in the same way.\n\n\nBirds also have the benefit of a bird's eye view. Human hikers lost in the woods sometimes must climb to the top of the nearest mountain to be able to see natural or man-made landscape features, like roads or coastlines, to find their way home. Birds just take to the sky where they get an awesome view of everything below them. Sometimes traveling south is as simple as following the path of a river that travels south to warmer temperatures.\n\n\nFinally, some scientists believe some birds may also get some of their guidance from Earth's magnetic field. Some species of birds have a highly-magnetic mineral called magnetite in their brains. Experts believe this mineral may help birds detect Earth's magnetic field and use it to guide them south.", "The flight paths used by birds in their annual migrations are called flyway s.\n\n\nScientists are not entirely sure how birds navigate their flyways. They seem to have an internal global positioning system (GPS) that allows them to follow the same pattern every year. A young bird imprint s on the sun and stars to help orient it. Some researchers think a bird may also recognize landmark s.\n\n\nIndividual organ s also contribute to a bird’s remarkable navigational ability. A bird’s eyes interact with its brain in a region called “cluster N”, which probably helps the bird determine which way is north. Tiny amounts of iron in the neurons of a bird’s inner ear also help in this determination.", "nother tool is the earth's magnetic field (earth's north and south magnetic poles). Some birds, like pigeons, have a small zone in their brain made of magnetite (magnetic mineral), just like a small compass. But other scientists think it's rather in their eyes that some birds have a system which indicates them where the magnetic north is...\n\n\nOf course, birds also use their knowledge of the landscape: they follow rivers, valleys or roads, or locate themselves with particular mountain peaks.\n\n\nOther tracks are still to be explored.

The use of an approved customs brokerage firm is required to coordinate the shipping of all international loans and may be required for certain domestic loans.", "If a courier is required, the Borrower will be responsible for all courier costs and any and all unforeseen expenditures required to assure the safe transport and installation of the lent artifacts as well as the transport of the courier. NASM retains the right to require that a loan be accompanied by a NASM staff courier (or outside contracted individual) and that unpacking, mounting, installation, de-installation, and repacking be supervised by the courier at the Borrower’s expense. Types of lent artifacts that generally require the aid of a courier include, but are not limited, to those possessing unique conservation concerns (such as spacesuits), highly fragile artifacts, artifacts that require specialized knowledge for installation or handling, and artifacts with high monetary or scholarly values. In addition to a courier, certain high value artifacts may require the use of specialized security escorts during transit.", "The short answer to the question in the title is – very, very carefully. Since exhibitions frequently change, museums have to transport a lot of precious, culturally important items. In addition to being priceless artifacts, many museum pieces are extremely delicate and don’t fit in a standard packing box. Moving any type of artifact is a massive undertaking that requires multiple moving experts.", "Moisture is the biggest cause of weather damage to artifacts. The slightest bit of humidity can damage items made of plant and animal materials. If the relative humidity is off it can also increase the chance of mildew and microbial growth.\n\n\nTemperature is also a concern. Extreme cold and hot temperatures could compromise some items. Moving in the spring or fall is a preferred time in some areas since the weather is usually more temperate. The ideal temperature for many artifacts is 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\nClimate has to be controlled at every stage, including short-term storage. If the truck containing the piece isn’t insulated during transport, consider how it can be packaged to provide extra insulation. Moving blankets are an excellent way to provide extra padding and insulation.\n\n\n### Give Items Plenty of Space\n\n\nPacking strategically is important anytime you move, but for museum quality pieces ample space is often needed. Instead of cramming everything in together like sardines to save space, heirlooms, artifacts and artwork may actually benefit from extra space.\n\n\nIf there’s any chance that friction or contact could damage a museum piece it’s placed in a crate or special packaging. Museums have even had to construct mounts, trays and supports to stabilize artifacts before they’re moved. When that’s not possible, the item is adequately secured in place and given plenty of room in the moving truck.\n\n\n### Special Packaging for Documents\n\n\nEven the documentation that authenticates a historical artifact or art piece is a vital item that has to be handled and packed with care. When you’re moving files moisture is again a top concern, but physical damage can also easily occur if documents aren’t packaged appropriately.\n\n\nFile boxes are designed to securely hold thousands of letter or legal size documents. File folders can also be used in the boxes to keep documents in order without causing any damage.\n\n\n### Limit Light and UV Exposure"], "report_en": "Transporting rare, valuable, irreplaceable museum artifacts is a “very, very careful” undertaking performed by teams of specialized movers because the pieces are priceless and extremely delicate [4].

The bank uses that money to fund someone’s:\n\n\n* Mortgage at 5.50% APR\n* Student loan at 6.65% APR\n* Credit card at 16.99% APR\n\n\nYour bank may have paid you $150 in a year’s time but they earned hundreds or thousands more from the interest on loans (made possible with your money).

Some typical financial products that charge fees are checking accounts, investment accounts, and credit cards. These fees are said to be for “maintenances purposes” even though maintaining these accounts costs banks relatively little.\n* ATM fees. There will be times when you can’t find your bank’s ATM and you must settle for another ATM just to get some cash. Well, that’s probably going to cost you $3. Such situations happen all the time and just mean more money for banks.", "* Penalty charges. Banks love to slap on a penalty fee for something a customer’s mishaps. It could a credit card payment that you sent in at 5:05PM. It could be a check written for an amount that was one penny over what you had in your checking account. Whatever it may be, expect to pay a late fee or a notorious overdraft fee or between $25 and $40. It sucks for customers, but the banks are having a blast.\n* Commissions. Most banks will have investment divisions that often function as full-service brokerages. Of course, their commission fees for making trades are higher than most discount brokers.\n* Application fees. Whenever a prospective borrower applies for a loan (especially a home loan) many banks charge a loan origination or application fee. And, they can take the liberty of including this fee amount into the principal of your loan—which means you’ll pay interest on it too!

It is important to recognize just how much the temperature of boiling water is reduced as the altitude increases.", "Water molecules have an easy time escaping off the surface when the air pressure above them is less. Since this is a naturally-occurring condition in high altitude regions, the boiling point of water is reduced and thus it attains the boiling", "It also impacts the boiling point of water: the temperature at which liquid water begins turning to vapor, which occurs when its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. At a higher elevation, the lower atmospheric pressure means heated water reaches its boiling point more quickly—i.e., at a lower temperature.

It adds tissue and structures around that wound,” DiMarino explains. “It’s also the process involved in a child’s growth and in building stronger muscles.”", "Catabolism functions no matter what you give your body, states DiMarino. It breaks down food, whether it’s junky or nutritious. Whatever it doesn’t use for energy now, it stores for later (hello, extra pounds). \r\n\r\n\r\nBut anabolism is entirely different. It only functions properly when you’re getting enough nutrients through foods like vegetables, fruits and lean meats.

In men, a pronounced jawline correlates with higher testosterone, which in turn is associated with virility and immune competence, making it appealing to women; sharp jawlines in women are likewise read as strength and reliability [3]. These consistent preferences across populations point to a biological basis.

Some sharks can identify blood a quarter-mile away, but the scent doesn’t reach them instantaneously or necessarily cause them to attack.\n\n\n[Image: blue shark nostrils]\n\n\nSharks have a heightened sense of smell and olfactory system that is hundreds of times stronger than a human’s. Their nostrils, located beneath their snouts, are used only for smelling and not for breathing. They do have the capacity to detect tiny amounts of various compounds in the water. Some types of sharks, such as the lemon shark, can even detect a scent in a large swimming pool or a substance that is several hundred meters away.\n\n\nBut a shark more than a quarter-mile away won’t smell your blood and decide to make you into a yummy snack. Smells reach a shark through the currents, and it would take time for the scent to travel that distance to a shark’s nostrils. The motion of the ocean carries smell molecules with it, so, the more motion, the faster the smell will travel.\n\n\nIf you do start to bleed while swimming in the ocean, there is some time to get safely to shore in case a rogue shark decides to attack.", "Sharks have nostrils that they only use to smell. When they swim, water flows through the nostrils, is introduced into the nasal duct and moves the last folds of the skin that has sensory cells. Some sharks, such as the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), can detect a small amount of blood in the water.\n\n\nThe sense of smell is directional, this means that if the aroma comes from the left side of the shark, the shark first perceives it precisely in the left fossa rather than the right and can detect the location of the source of the smelling.\n\n\nIt is necessary to emphasize that they are very sensitive to odors and can differentiate a prey from another shark and even from a predator and respond in a decisive way to the smell produced by a wounded or fearful prey."], "report_en": "The popular claim that a shark can smell a single drop of blood from kilometres away is exaggerated; laboratory and field data show most species, even those with exceptional noses, detect blood at roughly a quarter-mile (about 400 m) under favourable conditions [1].

No firewall works perfectly, and a lot of a firewall's effectiveness depends on how you configure it.\n\n\nTo get a basic grasp of how firewalls work, it's important to understand how TCP packets work.\n\n\nThe data that your computer sends and receives over the internet or an internal network is comprised of TCP packets and UDP packets. TCP packets can be more effectively filtered by firewalls because they contain more information in their headers.\n\n\n[Image]\n\n\nTCP packets contain information such as source and destination addresses, packet sequence information, and payload. That information allows your network interface to deliver data properly, and a firewall can compare that information to the rules you configured it with. For example, all HTTPS data is transmitted through TCP packets. When HTTPS data is sent to your computer through your network interface while you surf the web, your operating system will know that it's data that's supposed to go to your web browser. The same applies if you are surfing the web - on your phone, on your PC, or even on a server machine in your datacenter. With the proliferation of the Internet of Things, you might even be surfing the web from a touchscreen embedded in your refrigerator.

Huxley supported the theories of evolution by Charles Darwin and did not subscribe to religious beliefs. He believed that nature was too diverse to have been created and that natural selection provided a better explanation provable by evidence. Huxley thought that agnosticism was a principle and not a belief. He reiterated that it is wrong for one to claim a phenomenon is a definite truth unless logical evidence is provided. The word was coined as the antagonist of the phrase “Gnosticism,” meaning “knowledge.” Gnosticism was a religious ideology in the first and second centuries that suggested that the material world was ungodly while the spirit world was the better choice. Although agnosticism was not intended to raise the question of whether God exists or not, it found its way to the religious world. Huxley justified his stand by claiming that he did not deny or affirm the mortality or human and therefore, did not see the reason to believe or disprove the existence of God. He challenged the religious and atheists to prove or disprove the presence of God.", "“Maybe there is a God, but maybe not. I’m just not sure. I mean, who can really say?”\n\n\nIf you’ve ever uttered such words or heard someone else utter them, you’re dealing with agnosticism.\n\n\n“Agnostic” is a label people often use to indicate that they embrace an orientation somewhere between the serene surety of knowing that there is a God and the conviction that there isn’t.\n\n\nThat is, while a theist is someone who believes in God, and an atheist is someone who does not believe in God, an agnostic is someone who isn’t convinced that God exists, but at the same time, can’t be totally sure that God doesn’t exist.

Out of these, an ideal volcano to dump the trash would be a shield volcano. It is low profile lava, i.e. it has a slow eruption, with lave slowly spewing out onto the earth. However, the numbers of them are not very common. There are only 600 shield volcanoes, with most of them being inactive. There is the number of stratovolcanoes scattered on the earth, but they are known for their explosive nature. Thus, they are definitely not the spot for the dump.\n\n\n[Image]\n\n\nCredit-Tropical-Helicopters\n\n\nAbove all, disposing the trash into the lava would be a very expensive method. We have to have the endless stream of trucks traveling to the nearest active volcano to dispose of the trash.

Some studies indicate that replacing a dirty air filter increases fuel mileage on older, carburated cars by as much as 14 percent if the filter is so dirty it affects driveability. In addition, changing a clogged air filter can potentially increase acceleration by 6 to 11 percent on modern fuel-injected cars.

An example of this class of lever is a baseball bat. The handle of the bat is the fulcrum, you supply the input force near the middle, and the other end of the bat that pushes the ball with the output forces. In a third-class lever, the input force is greater than the output force but the output load is able to move farther.\n\n[Image: Examples of Levers]\n\nYou have several third-class levers in your body. One that is easy to investigate is your forearm.", "Bones, ligaments, and muscles are the structures that form levers in the body to create human movement. In simple terms, a joint (where two or more bones join together) forms the axis (or fulcrum), and the muscles crossing the joint apply the force to move a weight or resistance. Levers are typically labeled as first class, second class, or third class. All three types are found in the body, but most levers in the human body are third class.", "There are numerous third-class levers in the human body; one example can be illustrated in the elbow joint (figure 1.23b). The joint is the axis (fulcrum). The resistance (weight) is the forearm, wrist, and hand. The force is the biceps muscle when the elbow is flexed.", "## Mechanical Advantage in Biomechanics\n\nIt may seem confusing that most of the muscles in the human body are 3rd class levers, since these levers are at a mechanical disadvantage in terms of effort versus load. However, this only holds true in terms of resistance. The opposite is true when you consider the distal lever displacement. A small arc of motion proximally at the muscle insertion will create large angular displacement and velocity distally. Since most human movement is aimed at maximizing angular displacement of a distal segment through space, the use of 3rd class levers for is very efficient.\n\nThis creates a relationship between the lever arm distance, distal angular displacement/velocity, and torque production. The shorter the lever arm of the effort force (decreased mechanical advantage), the greater angular displacement and angular velocity of the distal end of the lever for a given arc of displacement of the effort force. The larger the lever arm of the effort force (increased mechanical advantage), the increased torque production.\n\nThis lever arm and force/torque production relationship needs to be taken into consideration when assessing movement and prescribing interventions. For example, applying a 5 pound weight at the distal end of a lever during a scaption/SLR exercise creates a mechanical disadvantage for the supraspinatus/illiopsoas. This results in the muscle being overloaded in attempt to create the amount of torque necessary for the distal angular displacement."], "report_en": "Human bones act as levers with joints as fulcrums and muscles as the applied force, and the majority of these levers are third class [2]. In a third-class lever the force is applied between fulcrum and load, so muscles must generate more force than the resistance, yet the load moves through a greater distance [1]. This arrangement sacrifices mechanical advantage but converts small, rapid muscle contractions into wide, fast movements of the hands, feet, and other distal segments, because a short effort arm produces large angular displacement and high velocity at the opposite end of the limb [4].

Singing makes Sara happy.\n\n\nIn the first sentence, “sings” is used as a verb. Sara is “doing” the action “to sing.” In the second sentence, “singing” is used as a gerund and “makes” is the verb.\n\n\nNote: A gerund will always be used as a noun and does not replace the progressive form of the verb."], "report_en": "A gerund is a verbal ending in “-ing” that functions as a noun [2]; in other words, it is a word formed from a verb but acting as a noun [1].

When people think about the Middle East, they think about oil. According to 2020 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 27 percent of the world’s current oil production is sourced from this region. For as long as fossil fuels have been a primary source of global energy, the Middle East has been one of the world’s foremost oil and gas suppliers.
