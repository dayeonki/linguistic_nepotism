These toxins can cause respiratory problems, allergic reactions and illness. George says aflatoxin, a specific type mycotoxin found in nuts and grains, can even be cancer-causing.\n\n\nMold is usually easy to spot. It often appears as a blue or green discoloration, which can grow a hairy coat if left long enough, Kirkpatrick says. If you’re examining foods in jars—things like pasta sauce or salsa—it’s best to check the underside of the lid and rim of the container for suspicious growths.\n\n\nJust don’t sniff your foods, Kirkpatrick warns, which could lead to you inhaling mold spores. If you’re worried about mold but don’t see any growths, use common sense. “If the food doesn’t look the way it normally would, and especially if it seems moisture-soaked, toss it,” Kirkpatrick says.\n\n\nThe exceptions: Hard block cheeses like parmesan, cheddar or Swiss. “With those, the mold generally won’t penetrate deep into the product,” Kirkpatrick says. But don’t start scraping, which can release mold spores into the air or allow them to spread to your countertops or other foods. The only safe way to remove that mold is to cut away an inch of cheese all the way around the spot, she says. “You’ll probably cut away some safe parts, but that’s a good rule of thumb.”"], "question_src": "为什么我可以在奶酪上吃霉菌，而不能在其他食物上吃霉？", "pos_context_title_src": ["你应该吃那种发霉的奶酪吗？ （www.mayoclinic.org）", "您问：我可以从食物上刮掉霉菌吗？ （time.com）"], "pos_context_src": ["当然，并非所有模具都构成风险。某些类型的霉菌用于制作奶酪，例如Br​​ie和Camembert。这些模具对于健康的成年人来说是安全的。但是，这些奶酪以及其他软奶酪和由未经糊涂的牛奶制成的奶酪和奶酪最好由免疫系统，老年人，孕妇，婴儿和幼儿的人避免使用。", "当存在可见的模具时，其触角（称为“线””可能会深入您的食物，甚至污染似乎没有霉菌的那些部分。\n\n\n霉菌暴露的健康风险很多。堪萨斯大学医院的临床营养师凯蒂·乔治（Katie George）说：“霉菌可以产生有毒物质，称为霉菌毒素。”这些毒素会引起呼吸问题，过敏反应和疾病。乔治说，黄曲霉毒素是一种在坚果和谷物中发现的特定类型的霉菌毒素，甚至可能是癌症的。\n\n\n霉菌通常很容易发现。 Kirkpatrick说，它通常是蓝色或绿色的变色，如果剩下足够长的时间，它可能会长出毛茸茸的外套。如果您正在检查罐子中的食物（例如意大利面酱或莎莎），最好检查容器的盖子和边缘的底面是否可疑生长。\n\n\nKirkpatrick警告，请不要嗅您的食物，这可能会导致您吸入霉菌孢子。如果您担心霉菌但看不到任何增长，请使用常识。柯克帕特里克（Kirkpatrick）说：“如果食物看起来不像通常一样，尤其是如果它看起来像是湿润的，那就扔掉了。”\n\n\nThe exceptions: Hard block cheeses like parmesan, cheddar or Swiss. “有了这些，霉菌通常不会深入产品，”柯克帕特里克说。但是不要开始刮擦，这可以将霉菌孢子释放到空中，或者让它们散布到台面或其他食物中。她说，去除该霉菌的唯一安全方法是将一英寸的奶酪整个地围绕在现场。 “您可能会切掉一些安全的零件，但这是一个很好的经验法则。”"], "comet_t": [0.84659343957901, 0.7245174050331116], "comet_c": [0.7198022603988647, 0.5303264856338501], "comet_q": 0.7545119524002075}

This occurrence is known as sensory attenuation and results in our brain deactivating our own tickle response.\n\n\nTry as we might, it's not possible to outsmart our own brains. Tickling serves a specific physical purpose when it comes to detecting danger, but it also plays a role in our emotions as well.

By taking away the feeling of unease and panic, the body no longer responds the same as it would if someone else were to tickle us.\n\n\nBrain scientists at the University College London have pinpointed the cerebellum as the part of the brain that prevents us from self-tickling. The cerebellum is the region located at the base of the brain that monitors our movements. It can distinguish expected sensations from unexpected sensations. An expected sensation would be the amount of pressure your fingers apply to your keyboard while typing. An unexpected sensation would be someone sneaking up behind you and tapping you on the shoulder.

The requirements for gaining these permits are stipulated at the state level. There must also be a public review period, which is often contentious. All permits must be obtained prior to beginning exploration, or the applicant may face delays and financial and legal penalties. In addition to permits, there are various standards and rules that companies must comply with when operating in the oil and gas industry.", "For two centuries, businesses have profited from using and selling the nation’s natural resources. The tradeoff in a free but regulated economic system such as that in the United States is to allow the continued extraction of natural resources but to require a commitment to protection of the environment in return.

However, this public-private collaboration is not without controversy.\n\n\nThe Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n\nThe case of the Keystone XL pipeline is an example of the emotional aspect of many environmental disputes, as our nation tries to come to grips with sustainability issues.

Wallace suggested that the bright colors worn by reef fish may actually help them hide in an equally colorful environment. While fish are pink and green and purple and blue, so are the corals, sponges and other parts of the visually complex background behind them. “He said, well, these colors might actually have a protective function — they might actually function like camouflage in a sense against these heterogeneous backgrounds,” Rosenthal says.", "The other idea is one developed by biologist Konrad Lorenz in the mid-20th century. He suggested that fish are conspicuously colored to help them identify their own species in the crowded reef environment, where there is direct competition between not only other species, but also members of their own.\n\n\nConsequently, colors may allow for individual recognition. Even with some reef fish’s intricate color pattern, no two are exactly alike. In his research on cleaner fish in the Indo-Pacific region, Lorenz studied striped cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus). While he couldn’t tag the little fish, he could photograph them and tell the difference between individuals by their markings in photographs. “If we can, you can bet they can,” he says.\n\n\nBy having “iconically different” color patterns, Rosenthal says, fish are able to minimize the costs of aggression — in other words, if you’re different from everyone you’re not competing with, you’re not going to have a lot of inter-species conflict that would sap your energy.", "One of the ways they’ve done it is to use light conditions to communicate signals — mating, camouflage and territory — in a context that matches the clarity of the water.\n\n\n“What this means is that fish on a reef in the Caribbean near the surface, can basically use color information and fine spatial information to encode species identity,” Rosenthal says. “In the Pacific, you don’t have that luxury anymore, because there’s not as much light, and there’s not as much fidelity of spatial information.”"], "question_src": "为什么生活在珊瑚礁周围的鱼似乎比不居住在珊瑚礁周围的鱼更丰富多彩？", "pos_context_title_src": ["为什么礁鱼如此丰富多彩？美丽背后的科学|潜水新闻，装备，教育|潜水培训杂志（dtmag.com）", "为什么礁鱼如此丰富多彩？美丽背后的科学|潜水新闻，装备，教育|潜水培训杂志（dtmag.com）", "为什么礁鱼如此丰富多彩？美丽背后的科学|潜水新闻，装备，教育|潜水培训杂志（dtmag.com）"], "pos_context_src": ["Losty说：“不仅可以说明一个解释，这就是最重要的。” “将会有很多因素。”\n\n\n####为什么它们这么漂亮？\n\n\n但是，科学界有两个大型理论，解释了为什么鱼如此丰富多彩。\n\n\n阿尔弗雷德·罗素·华莱士（Alfred Russel Wallace）首先考虑了一个，这是19世纪查尔斯·达尔文（Charles Darwin）的鲜为人知但同样重要的当代。华莱士（Wallace）建议，礁鱼所穿的鲜艳颜色实际上可能有助于它们隐藏在同样丰富多彩的环境中。虽然鱼是粉红色，绿色，紫色和蓝色的，但珊瑚，海绵和其他视觉背景的其他部分也是如此。罗森塔尔说：“他说，这些颜色实际上可能具有保护功能 - 从某种意义上说，它们实际上可能像伪装一样起作用。”", "另一个想法是由生物学家Konrad Lorenz在20世纪中叶开发的。他建议鱼在拥挤的礁环境中识别自己的物种，在拥挤的环境中识别自己的物种，不仅在其他物种之间，而且他们自己的成员之间都有直接的竞争。\n\n\n因此，颜色可以允许个人识别。即使有一些礁鱼的复杂颜色图案，也没有两个完全一样。洛伦兹（Lorenz）在印度太平洋地区的清洁剂鱼类的研究中研究了条纹清洁剂（Labroides dimidiatus）。虽然他无法标记小鱼，但他可以通过照片中的标记来拍照，并通过他们的标记来分辨个人之间的区别。他说：“如果可以的话，您可以打赌他们可以。”\n\n\n罗森塔尔说，通过具有“图像不同”的颜色模式，Fish能够最大程度地降低侵略性的成本 - 换句话说，如果您与不竞争的每个人不同，那么您将不会有很多种间冲突会损害您的精力。", "他们这样做的方法之一是使用光条件在与水的清晰度相匹配的情况下传达信号（交流，伪装和领土）。\n\n\nRosenthal说：“这意味着，在表面附近的加勒比海礁石上的鱼类基本上可以使用颜色信息和精细的空间信息来编码物种身份。” “在太平洋，您已经没有那种奢侈了，因为没有那么多光，而且空间信息没有太多的忠诚。”"], "comet_t": [0.8570020794868469, 0.8570020794868469, 0.8570020794868469], "comet_c": [0.678109884262085, 0.6974417567253113, 0.7977737188339233], "comet_q": 0.8686357736587524}

When milk is heated rapidly, some of the water in it evaporates from the surface. This exposes proteins and fat molecules, which bind and dry out as warming continues. Skin most commonly forms when milk is heated over a stove top, as stoves are generally capable of reaching very high temperatures quite quickly, though it can happen in the microwave as well.

In truth, it is rare to encounter milk that is truly fat free. Most of the skim milk that is sold commercially has very low fat content, but is rarely ever truly fat-free. Even trace amounts of fat on the surface can contribute to skin formation.\n\n\nA similar phenomenon happens with soy milk, which is generally marketed as fat free. Natural fats still occur in trace amounts, and can be drawn to the surface when exposed to very high temperatures. Soy film can be discarded, but is also considered a delicacy in many Asian cultures. When removed and dried, it is referred to as yuba, or soybean curd, which is used in a variety of recipes.", "Milk skin or lactoderm refers to a sticky film of protein that forms on top of dairy milk and foods containing dairy milk (such as hot chocolate and some soups). Milk film can be produced both through conventional boiling and by microwaving the liquid, and as such can often be observed when heating milk for use in drinks such as drinking chocolate. It is caused by the denaturation of proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin (whey protein). The thickness of the skin varies dependent on a number of factors, including the temperature of the milk, the shape of the container, and the amount of milk in the container.\n\n\nWhen milk is boiled, soluble milk proteins are denatured and then coagulate with milk's fat and form a sticky film across the top of the liquid, which then dries by evaporation.

So people who recall dreams may have a difference in their ability to memorize things in general.\n\n\nBeyond that, a person’s brain may actually block out a dream so we don’t remember it the following day. “The dream activity can be so real and intense that our brains actually hide, or mask away the dream, so [it doesn’t] get lost between our waking experience, and our dream lives. Thus it is normal to forget dreams, most of the time.” Dimitriu says.", "A study published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology and reported by International Business Times suggested that those people who reported high dream recall had more activity in the temporoparietal junction than those who didn’t recall their dreams often.\n\n\nLambert tells Healthline that if someone consistently doesn’t get enough sleep, the amount of REM sleep they experience will drop, making it harder for them to remember their dreams the following day.\n\n\nEven personality traits can be an indicator of whether someone will be able to remember their dreams.\n\n\nLambert continues: “Researchers also looked at the most common personality traits that are presented in people who can recall their dreams. Overall, such people are prone to daydreaming, creative thinking, and introspection. At the same time, those who are more practical and focused on what is outside themselves tend to have difficulty remembering their dreams.”\n\n\nThis may mean that some people are naturally more likely to recall their dreams than others, despite their quality of sleep.\n\n\nOther factors, like stress or experiencing a trauma, can also cause people to have vivid dreams or nightmares that they’re more likely to recall the next day. For example, a person who’s coping with grief after losing a loved one may dream about the death in elaborate detail. Remembering the dream the next day may affect mood and cause even more stress or anxiety.", "People who have the ability to recall their dreams five mornings per week, on average, have more spontaneous activity occurring in certain parts of their brains than others. The parts of the brain that host these increased levels of activity are called the temporo-parietal junction, which is an information-processing hub, and the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for the expression of personality as well as the planning of complex cognitive behaviors. And, interestingly, this escalation in liveliness is higher during both wakefulness and sleep, so says a study of 41 people recently published online February 19 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology. The activity in the brains of the people in this study were measured by Positron Emission Tomography while they were awake and sleeping. What do these findings tell us?\n\n\nIn combination with previous research from one of the study’s authors, Perrine Ruby, the findings tell us why some people remember their dreams and some do not. Ruby co-authored related research that was published last year in the journal Cerebral Cortex, which showed that people who have the ability to regularly recall their dreams are also more reactive to sounds when they are both asleep and awake. Ruby made some comments in a recent statement that synthesized the findings for both of these studies. Ruby stated that the brain needs to awaken from sleep in order to memorize new information. This, said Ruby, may explain the reason that those who react more to environmental stimuli can remember their dreams better; they simply are awakened more often and can therefore better encode into memory their dreams than others who are less reactive to sounds.

However, the main optical principle at work, and one that is quite fascinating, is called the “pinhole effect”. Clear vision is a result of light rays that properly focused on the retina located in the back of the eye. Typically, this is done with glasses or contact lenses; both of which bend light into focus and therefore correct vision.\n\n\nWhen we squint it creates the same effect as looking through a pinhole. Basically only a small amount of focused central light rays are allowed into the eye. This prevents the unfocused light rays in the periphery from reaching the retina. The result is better vision. Photographers understand this as “depth of field”.", "The reason that squinting helps you see is because it changes the shape of your eye, making the pupil smaller, thus letting less light in and making an image clear. This is similar to the way a larger aperture works; a smaller hole in your camera lets less light in, with better focus.", "By limiting the rays of light that come in through the bottom and top of the pupil, squinting allows rays to pass closer to the center of the lens, thereby creating a more focused image.

Some of the leftover dust formed the moons of the planets (although the origin of Earth's moon is still up for debate). Some of this dust was too close to the planet to form stable moons, and instead formed rings. It is likely that large rings couldn't form on inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) because the rings are made of frozen icy dust, and the sun is too hot this close to it for the rings to form.", "“There are various theories about planetary rings, like the fantastic rings around Saturn, but we cannot say for sure how they are formed,” explains Lattis.\n\n\nOne theory is that the rings formed at the same time as the planet and its major moons. In this case, if material is close to the planet, the planet’s gravitational pull is too strong to coalesce into a moon and the particles that would otherwise form a moon spread out in orbit around the planet as a ring.\n\n\nAnother idea is that a close call by a moon or comet results in the planet’s gravitational tidal force breaking up those bodies, the debris of which then becomes a ring system.", "The larger volume of space and lower gravity of the Sun in the giant-planet region allowed Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to form like solar systems in miniature. We think each of them pulled in lots of material and had a disk of gas, dust, and ice surrounding it during formation. Any dust and ice not incorporated into the planet itself would have coalesced into the regular moons we see today around the giant planets. These satellites are in nearly circular orbits near the equators of their host planets, such as the four Galilean satellites around Jupiter and Titan around Saturn, which are all composed of large fractions of ice.\n\n\nBecause the giant planets gravitationally dominate a very large area, they also can efficiently capture passing objects as moons, which we call irregular satellites. These irregular moons are relatively small and have orbits with large inclinations, eccentricities, and semimajor axes.\n\n\nIn contrast, the terrestrial planets formed much closer to the Sun with much less material around them. They grew slowly by accreting many small rocky planetesimals and never grew massive enough to capture a disk of gas and dust. Earth’s Moon probably formed through a direct collision.

The question of how it manages to do so in the absence of a medium is explained by the nature of electromagnetic vibrations. When a charged particle vibrates, it produces an electrical vibration that automatically induces a magnetic one -- physicists often visualize these vibrations occurring in perpendicular planes. The paired oscillations propagate outward from the source; no medium, except for the electromagnetic field that permeates the universe, is required to conduct them.", "When I say \"waves of electric and magnetic fields,\" I'm talking about something similar to the waves in the rope. Similar to wiggling the end of the rope, we can change the electric or magnetic field at one point, and that disturbance travels away from us. (One way to change the magnetic field at a point is to hold a magnet there, then wiggle it back and forth.) Unlike the wave in the rope, these waves actually travel away from us in all directions. It turns out that in a vacuum, for example in outer space, these waves travel at exactly the speed of light! It doesn't matter how rapidly the fields wiggle back and forth, they will always travel at the same speed. (In air, the waves go ever so slightly slower than in vacuum, and in glass, they can go only about two-thirds as fast as they would in vacuum, but this is not important right now. From now on, when I talk about the speed of light, I mean the speed of light in a vacuum, and I'm talking about waves traveling in a vacuum.) The conclusion that physicists have drawn from this result is that light consists of waves of electric and magnetic fields. This is a fascinating result: that we learn something about light by studying magnets and electrical currents.", "In contrast, light waves can travel through a vacuum, and do not require a medium. In empty space, the wave does not dissipate (grow smaller) no matter how far it travels, because the wave is not interacting with anything else. This is why light from distant stars can travel through space for billions of light-years and still reach us on earth. However, light can also travel within some materials, like glass and water.

For example, they must always say \"fishing,\" not \"fishin'.\" They also speak more slowly than people do in daily life in order to be easily understandable, Caples said.\n\n\nThere's the added fact that most broadcasters are emulating the voices of their role models, and so speech patterns get passed down. \"I think there's a lot of patterning,\" she said. \"If you've grown up listening to a certain anchor, or admire someone on TV, then there's a subconscious effort to mirror that. A lot of women want to sound like Oprah, for example; she has a great voice.\"", "Some anchors have also reported being more careful with their speech because broadcast microphones are often unforgiving. Words beginning with P tend to pop, for example. Broadcasting school drills out the kind of casual and conversational voice that doesn’t translate well to a newscast.\n\n\nOf course, some linguists believe there’s no such thing as being totally free of an accent. A Southerner trying to remove any trace of a drawl is going to sound different than someone from New England attempting to do the same. We may not notice simply because humans aren’t that great at recognizing more subtle accents, especially our own.

Fast-forward another 70,000 years and early man has recognized the value of sharpened flint, not only good for striking fire, but also for delicately slicing off hair from the body!\n\n[Image: not only do i keep my face smooth but i also built this computer meme]\n\nThe real history of shaving, however, doesn’t begin until we reach the Egyptian civilization, where the act of shaving made its real debut on the world stage. Egyptians had a powerful belief that body hair was a sign of uncleanliness, so both men and women engaged in the complete removal of hair from the body—head to toe! In some cases, caustic ingredients like quicklime and arsenic were used in these primitive depilatory creams and shaving lotions. Early razors also appeared around the time, with the rise in metalworking and mining in many areas of the world. The Egyptian relationship to cleanliness and body hair bordered on the obsessive, and the upper classes often bathed multiple times per day. They would shave their heads completely bald, and then design cooling wigs to wear out in public.\n\nThe fear of uncleanliness was a real concern, and may have been the early reason for prehistoric man to shave as well.

It is a proven method for potable drinking water. * Countries are less dependent on natural resources which can now begin replenishing via the water cycle. * Even better, the process of RO purification of waste from industries can give safe water that can be used to refill the aquifer, lakes, reservoirs of the region and in turn lifting stress from the environment.\n\nPlants have been set across the world in Australia, U.S, Saudi Arabia and more where each day tens of thousands of gallons of freshwater are produced from an endless supply of the sea.\n\n“It is a growing trend.

The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce who developed heliography and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.[3][4] Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, airbrushing, or scratching Polaroids during developing (Polaroid art).[5] Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the darkroom by piecing photos or negatives together. Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash-out parts of the photograph, or hand coloring for aesthetic purposes or to mimic a fine art painting.[6]", "In a 2013 blog post for Fstoppers, professional retoucher Pratik Naik described the painstaking process as such:\n\n\n“Need to zoom into a photo? Be sure to bust out the magnifying glass and a bottle of patience along with that steady hand of yours. No sorry, there’s no history states or layers. You can also forget about that wonderful healing brush! Here’s a paint brush instead”\n\n\nArt directors, graphic designers, and publishers labored long hours over images, attempting to perfect skin, materials, and other issues which, today, would be easily whisked away with the click of a mouse. Tools like paint, erasers, airbrushes, and other art supplies were necessary in any studio — as was a steady hand and a keen eye for color and shadow. You can even see some of the hard work that went into perfecting photos in this annotation of a famous Dennis Stock image, which has been marked up by Pablo Inirio.", "MIA FINEMAN: Most of the earliest manipulated photographs were attempts to compensate for the new medium’s technical limitations — specifically, its inability to depict the world as it appears to the naked eye.\n\n\nWhen photography was first introduced in 1839, people wondered how a medium that could render forms and textures with such exquisite detail could fail to register the ever-present element of color. Eager to please potential customers, photographers immediately resorted to manual intervention, enlivening their pictures with powdered pigment, watercolor and oil paint.\n\n\nEarly photography was color-blind in other ways as well. In the 19th century, photographic emulsions were much more sensitive to blue and violet light than to other colors on the spectrum, which meant that blue skies almost always appeared blotchy and overexposed. To overcome the problem, many landscape photographers would make two separate negatives — one exposed for the land, the other for the sky — and print them together on a single sheet of paper. The French photographer Gustave Le Gray used this technique in his majestic seascapes of the 1850s. The exhibition features three seascapes by Le Gray, all using the same cloud negative.

If the door went all the way to the floor, other occupants might not be able to notice if someone in a stall was having a problem and lost consciousness. The gap provides visibility in case a person inside is in some kind of distress. It also helps first responders, who could pull the occupant out without having to break down the door.\n\n\nA gap also provides just enough of a dent in privacy to make any kind of undesirable public behavior—like sexual activity or drug use—less practical.\n\n\nThere are economical and logistical considerations, too. Doors that come only part of the way down are universal, meaning that suppliers and installers don’t need to custom-measure them. This saves on costs. Small doors also make cleaning floors in and around the stalls easier. This was the motivation behind the partitions famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed for the influential Larkin Building that stood in Buffalo, New York, from 1903 to 1950. Many of his ideas, like small bathroom doors, became a standard of business construction.\n\n\nIf you’re still not convinced gaps are a design win, consider that an enclosed stall is going to have only limited air circulation. The last thing you want or need in a public bathroom is to trap odors. It also helps keep loitering to a minimum. (Then again, so would the stench.)", "Easier to Clean: By having a gap at the bottom, bathroom partitions are much easier to clean, as is the whole restroom. You can hose down or even powerwash a restroom that has partitions with gaps at the bottom because the water has somewhere to run even if there’s not a drain in a given stall.\n* Emergency Access: If someone loses consciousness in a fully enclosed bathroom, it may take hours for someone to notice. If this happens in a stall with a gap at the bottom, the odds are good someone will notice much quicker, which is important in instances where every second can mean the difference between life and death. Instead of having to break down the door, a first responder can crawl through the gap at the bottom of the partition and unlock the door to render help.\n* Deterrent to Undesirable Behavior: Because people can partially see into a bathroom stall that has a gap at the bottom, this type of partition is a natural deterrent to undesirable behavior, such as someone spray painting the stall with graffiti.\n* More Affordable: Partitions that don’t extend from the floor to the ceiling don’t have to be custom made to fit a room’s exact measurements and they don’t require as many materials to construct. This makes them considerably more affordable.\n* Better Air Circulation: Better air circulation is one of the top reasons why there are gaps under toilet stalls. While restrooms with this kind of partition may still get a bit stinky from time to time, things would be even more overwhelming in a fully enclosed stall.\n* Keeps the Line Moving: Having a gap at the base of a partition allows people waiting in line to see if a stall is occupied or vacant. This visibility keeps the line moving and prevents wait times from being any longer than they have to be. When a stall isn’t fully enclosed, people often feel like they have to take care of their business even faster, which also helps keep the line moving.\n* ADA Compliance: Space is needed to allow for easier maneuverability for patrons in a wheelchair.

Eventually these clumps of material grew large enough to develop their own gravitational fields.\n\n\nAs the forming planets continued to grow, the force of the collisions with additional matter caused them to become hot and molten, acting much like a liquid. Each planet's gravitational force is centered at its core. It pulls equally in every direction from the core, thus pulling all the molten material into a spherical shape.

The technical name for this process is \"isostatic adjustment.\"\n\n\nWith much smaller bodies, such as the 20-kilometer asteroids we have seen in recent spacecraft images, the gravitational pull is too weak to overcome the asteroid's mechanical strength.

In some cases, these weather modifiers were trying to produce rain in drought-afflicted areas, mitigate hail damage by preventing hailstones from growing so large, or disperse fog banks around airports. Many proprietors of this new technology made audacious claims about their cloud seeding services. Unfortunately, hard science could never substantiate the claims. If anything, rigorous experimentation seemed to suggest that cloud seeding barely worked or, worse, didn't work at all.\n\nStill, enough tantalizing evidence has accumulated over the years to keep interest in weather modification alive. For example, research conducted in South Africa and Mexico has shown that seeding warm rain clouds with salt particles -- what is known as hygroscopic seeding -- is more effective than seeding cold rain clouds with silver iodide.

Through approving your webpage, your audience knows that they are more or less protected when browsing or buying from your page.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with HTTPS and SSL, you’ll want to brush up on what they mean and what they include. Let’s begin by taking a look at what HTTPS and SSL stand for.\n\nHTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, meaning that the communication between your visitor and your website is secure and encrypted.\n\nThere are a number of benefits to having an HTTPS website over a standard HTTP, especially if your visitor is frequently entering detailed or sensitive information when they visit your site. If your customer needs to enter credit card information or other personal information, you’ll want to have an HTTPS page.\n\nHaving an HTTPS shows your visitor that you’re a valid company, so they don’t need to be worried about entering credit card information to make a purchase online. The information they do enter will become encrypted, so it cannot be stolen or intercepted.\n\nYour HTTPS website can establish a stronger level of trust with your customer. When they know that their information is protected, they’ll be more likely to purchase from your company over your competition.\n\n## What is SSL?\n\nSSL, which stands for Secure Socket Layer, works with your HTTPS website to protect your customer’s information and privacy. SSL, which may also be called TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is the encryption communication that your HTTPS website will use to encrypt the information a customer or client puts into your website.", "Both SSH and SSL are public-key cryptography protocols that create a secure, confidential exchange of data and connection across the Internet. Let’s discuss some of the major key differences:\n\n 1. Usually, SSH uses Port 22, whereas SSL uses Port 443. 2. SSH uses a username/password authentication process to establish a secure connection, whereas SSL does not consider it. 3. SSH is based on network tunnelling, whereas SSL is based on certificates. 4. SSL is used for securely transmitting critical information like credit cards and banking. Whereas SSH is used for securely executing commands across the Internet. 5. SSL is used for encrypting communication between browser and server. On the other hand, SSH is used for encrypting communication between two computers over the Internet. 6. In SSL, the communication is authenticated via the private-key/public-key pair. Whereas in SSH, the communication is authenticated via private-key/public-key pair or username/password pair. 7. Technically, SSH is for securing computer networks, whereas SSL is for securing online data transfers. 8. SSL generally (except exceptions) uses X.509 digital certificates for server and client authentication processes, whereas SSH does not. 9. Another major difference is that SSH has more built-in functionality than SSL. It helps in enabling users to log in to a server and execute commands remotely, whereas SSL does not have this functionality.

Until recently, most neuroscientists believed that this latter type of temporal processing – the kind that alerts you when you’ve lingered over breakfast for too long – is supported by a single brain system. However, emerging research indicates that the model of a single neural clock might be too simplistic. A new study, recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience by neuroscientists at the University of California, Irvine, reveals that the brain may in fact have a second method for sensing elapsed time. What’s more, the authors propose that this second internal clock not only works in parallel with our primary neural clock, but may even compete with it.\n\n\nPast research suggested that a brain region called the striatum lies at the heart of our central inner clock, working with the brain’s surrounding cortex to integrate temporal information.", "According to Bejan—who reviewed previous studies in a range of fields on time, vision, cognition, and mental processing to reach his conclusion—time as we experience it represents perceived changes in mental stimuli. It’s related to what we see. As physical mental-image processing time and the rapidity of images we take in changes, so does our perception of time. And in some sense, each of us has our own “mind time” unrelated to the passing of hours, days, and years on clocks and calendars, which is affected by the amount of rest we get and other factors.", "It has also been shown that the cerebellum plays a key role in motor tasks requiring perception of implicit timing. Other parts of the brain may be involved in implicit-timing estimates: for example, the left parietal cortex, which manages intended movement, and the left premotor cortex, which plans and organises movement. Sometimes the right prefrontal cortex, usually involved in explicit-timing estimates, is activated for implicit estimates, for instance, when an event does not occur as soon as expected: a traffic light stays red for longer than foreseen. The brain updates its time forecasts, once again anticipating the interval.\n\n\nIn addition, \"the regions of the brain involved differ depending on the context, particularly if the stimulus only lasts for a very short time, less than 200 milliseconds,\" says Coull. The visual cortex is activated when we estimate the duration of a visual stimulus.

The consensus has been that a bicycle's stability is related to two factors: First, the rotating wheels of the bicycle provide stability through gyroscopic effects; secondly, that the ‘trail’, the distance by which the contact point of the front wheel trails behind the steering axis, plays an important part.\n\nA new study in Science claims to have settled the issue - gyroscopic effects and trail help, says researcher Dr Arend Schwab of the 3mE faculty at TU Delft, but are not necessary above a certain speed . In a 2007 Proceedings of the Royal Society article (doi:10.1098/rspa.2007.1857), a mathematical model with around 25 physical parameters was developed at the time which appeared to predict whether, and at what speeds, a particular design of bicycle would be stable.", "A bicycle, on the other hand, is statically unstable because it only has two contact points with the ground (whatever portion of the front and back wheels happen to be touching the ground) and its base of support is a line segment. A good base of support needs at least three contact points with the ground, so bikes are hard to keep upright when they're still. Bikes are, however, dynamically stable, or stable when moving forward, because steering allows a rider to move the bike's points of support around under the center of gravity and keep it balanced, often with steering adjustments small enough that the rider may not even realize they're making them. It's sort of like standing on one foot. If you don't hop around a little, and you start falling sideways, you can't recover and you fall over. If you do hop, though, you can move your foot around to keep your center of gravity above it and keep your balance.\n\n\nA bike has two features that help this dynamic stability immensely: its wheels. Spinning wheels have angular momentum, and when you're sitting on a bike, you and it and its wheels make up a system that obeys the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Unless torque, or twisting force, is applied from outside the system to change the wheels' angular momentum, that momentum and the direction of the momentum remain constant. In a nutshell, once the wheels line up a certain way, they want to stay lined up like that. It's easy for you to move them, but hard for an outside force to do the same, and so the bike is easy to keep balanced but doesn't topple easily. A non-moving bike has wheels that aren't spinning and zero angular momentum, which makes it very easy for external torque to change the wheels' direction, making the bike harder to balance."], "question_src": "为什么我的自行车静止不动，而在移动时不稳定？", "pos_context_title_src": ["为什么移动的自行车停留？ （www.science20.com）", "骑自行车平衡：现象（www.mentalfloss.com）"], "pos_context_src": ["由于发明了自行车，因此S Cientists假定了自行车为何自行稳定以上的速度以上的自行车的各种原因。共识是，自行车的稳定性与两个因素有关：首先，自行车的旋转轮通过陀螺效应提供稳定性；其次，“小径”（前轮的接触点在转向轴后面的距离）起着重要的作用。\n\n一项新的科学研究声称已经解决了这个问题 - 陀螺症的影响和TRAIL帮助。在皇家学会文章（DOI：10.1098/rspa.2007.1857）的2007年论文集中，当时开发了一个大约25个物理参数的数学模型，似乎可以预测，以什么速度，特定的自行车设计是稳定的。", "另一方面，自行车在静态不稳定上是不稳定的，因为它与地面只有两个接触点（无论前轮和后轮的任何部分碰巧碰到了地面），并且其支撑底座的基础是线段。良好的支持基础至少需要与地面的三个接触点，因此自行车在静止时很难保持直立。但是，自行车在向前移动时动态稳定或稳定，因为转向使骑手可以在重心下方移动自行车的支撑点并保持平衡，并且通常会带有足够小的转向调整，以至于骑手可能甚至没有意识到他们在制造它们。有点像站在一只脚上。如果您不跳一些，而又开始侧面跌落，那么您将无法恢复而跌倒。但是，如果您确实跳跃，则可以移动脚以将重心保持在其上方并保持平衡。\n\n\n自行车具有两个功能，可以极大地帮助这种动态稳定性：其车轮。旋转的车轮具有角动力，当您坐在自行车上时，您和它的车轮构成了一个系统，遵守了角度动量的保护原则。除非从系统外部施加扭矩或扭曲力以改变车轮的角动量，否则动量和动量的方向保持恒定。简而言之，一旦车轮以某种方式排队，他们希望像这样保持排队。您很容易移动它们，但是外部力量很难做同样的事情，因此自行车很容易保持平衡，但并不容易倾倒。一辆非移动的自行车的车轮没有旋转，角度动量为零，这使得外部扭矩非常容易改变车轮的方向，从而使自行车更难平衡。"], "comet_t": [0.6762012243270874, 0.699918806552887], "comet_c": [0.6092281341552734, 0.5998636484146118], "comet_q": 0.7351230382919312}

In 1569, the Belgian geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator created his method for presenting a spherical world on a flat map, the one familiar to us today. This mapmaking technique, though it stretched and compressed landmarks and distances between them, had the great advantage that a straight compass course was represented by a straight line on the map.\n\n\nMercator’s projections began to be used to sail the open seas by the early 1800s, by which time portolan charts had pretty much disappeared. But their importance is undeniable. “The development of these maps revolutionized how people perceived space, much like Google Earth has done in our lifetimes,” Hessler says. “Understanding how the technology was developed gives us insight into how we got here, and perhaps into where we’re going.”"], "question_src": "在卫星发明之前，如何将大陆，国家和海岸线绘制出来？", "pos_context_title_src": ["制图师是如何在现代之前将海岸绘制的？ （utdoors.stackexchange.com）", "制图师是如何在现代之前将海岸绘制的？ （utdoors.stackexchange.com）", "制图师是如何在现代之前将海岸绘制的？ （utdoors.stackexchange.com）", "非常准确的中世纪地图的奥秘（www.discovermagazine.com）"], "pos_context_src": ["“驾驶”。通过驾驶，您将使用准确地图上参考点的轴承确定位置。在这里，我们使用轴承对物体来确定沿海岸线的点位置。尽管如此，它的工作方式几乎相同。\n\n\n地图 - 尤其是海岸线 - 几乎可以肯定是由从船上拍摄的观察结果制成的。海军导航比在土地上的导航（尤其是没有好的地图！）要准确得多。", "在1700年代中期之前，导航的主要手段是死亡的（DR）。这要求您使用方向和距离从最后一个已知的位置迭代地将您在地图上的位置提高。当然，随着时间的流逝，错误会增加准确性的降低。您必须有一种方法来衡量旅行方向和速度（某些）准确的价值。\n\n\n在1700年代的晚些时候，可以使用天体导航更准确地导航。这使熟练的导航器可以在全球任何时候都相当准确地确定其位置（通常在几英里之内）。该位置通常每天每天一次找到一次，并根据需要使用DR提前。", "导航和制图的主题是同一枚硬币的两个方面，每本书都写了整本书。研究制图的历史很有趣，因为它非常图形地显示了随着时间的推移导航的相应改进。\n\n\n为了制作准确的地图，您需要首先知道从哪里进行观察。从先前已知的位置进行观察将导致更高的准确性。该立场可能是由较早的调查（例如，从现有地图上的已知点工作）建立的，或者能够在地球范围内良好地确定自己的位置。", "问题是波托兰地图制造商缺乏将球形地球减少到平坦地图的系统方式。对于短途旅行而言，这并没有什么后果，但是在航行更长的距离时，它的影响力更多。 1569年，比利时的地理学家和制图师Gerardus Mercator创建了他的方法，是在平坦地图上展示球形世界的方法，这是当今我们所熟悉的。这种地图制作技术虽然拉伸和压缩的地标及其之间的距离，但具有很大的优势，即直线指南针的路线由地图上的一条直线表示。\n\n\nMercator的预测开始在1800年代初开始航行开放海洋，到那时波尔托兰的排行榜几乎消失了。但是它们的重要性是不可否认的。赫斯勒说：“这些地图的发展彻底改变了人们对空间的看法，就像Google Earth在我们一生中所做的那样。” “了解如何开发技术使我们深入了解我们如何到达这里，也许可以进入要去的地方。”"], "comet_t": [0.8068150877952576, 0.8068150877952576, 0.8068150877952576, 0.8573697805404663], "comet_c": [0.8035299777984619, 0.721242368221283, 0.8051861524581909, 0.7805864810943604], "comet_q": 0.8763061761856079}

This \"conciliar\" year divided the year into \"prytanies,\" one for each of the \"phylai,\" the subdivisions of Athenian citizens. The number of phylai, and hence the number of prytanies, varies over time. Until 307 BCE, there were 10 phylai.\n\nAfter that the number varies between 11 and 13 (usually 12).

The Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Birds flying south for the winter can stay on track by using the Sun's position in the sky throughout the day as a guide.\n\n\nOf course, once the Sun sets, it isn't much help as a guide. Luckily, many birds can also navigate by the position of the stars in the sky once night rolls around. Constellations guided many sailors at night before modern technology came along. Birds can use the stars as navigational aids in the same way.\n\n\nBirds also have the benefit of a bird's eye view. Human hikers lost in the woods sometimes must climb to the top of the nearest mountain to be able to see natural or man-made landscape features, like roads or coastlines, to find their way home. Birds just take to the sky where they get an awesome view of everything below them. Sometimes traveling south is as simple as following the path of a river that travels south to warmer temperatures.\n\n\nFinally, some scientists believe some birds may also get some of their guidance from Earth's magnetic field.

Moving in the spring or fall is a preferred time in some areas since the weather is usually more temperate. The ideal temperature for many artifacts is 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\nClimate has to be controlled at every stage, including short-term storage.

Moving blankets are an excellent way to provide extra padding and insulation.\n\n\n### Give Items Plenty of Space\n\n\nPacking strategically is important anytime you move, but for museum quality pieces ample space is often needed. Instead of cramming everything in together like sardines to save space, heirlooms, artifacts and artwork may actually benefit from extra space.\n\n\nIf there’s any chance that friction or contact could damage a museum piece it’s placed in a crate or special packaging.

TCP packets can be more effectively filtered by firewalls because they contain more information in their headers.\n\n\n[Image]\n\n\nTCP packets contain information such as source and destination addresses, packet sequence information, and payload. That information allows your network interface to deliver data properly, and a firewall can compare that information to the rules you configured it with. For example, all HTTPS data is transmitted through TCP packets. When HTTPS data is sent to your computer through your network interface while you surf the web, your operating system will know that it's data that's supposed to go to your web browser. The same applies if you are surfing the web - on your phone, on your PC, or even on a server machine in your datacenter. With the proliferation of the Internet of Things, you might even be surfing the web from a touchscreen embedded in your refrigerator.

He believed that nature was too diverse to have been created and that natural selection provided a better explanation provable by evidence.

Although agnosticism was not intended to raise the question of whether God exists or not, it found its way to the religious world. Huxley justified his stand by claiming that he did not deny or affirm the mortality or human and therefore, did not see the reason to believe or disprove the existence of God.

An example of this class of lever is a baseball bat. The handle of the bat is the fulcrum, you supply the input force near the middle, and the other end of the bat that pushes the ball with the output forces. In a third-class lever, the input force is greater than the output force but the output load is able to move farther.\n\n[Image: Examples of Levers]\n\nYou have several third-class levers in your body. One that is easy to investigate is your forearm.", "Bones, ligaments, and muscles are the structures that form levers in the body to create human movement. In simple terms, a joint (where two or more bones join together) forms the axis (or fulcrum), and the muscles crossing the joint apply the force to move a weight or resistance. Levers are typically labeled as first class, second class, or third class. All three types are found in the body, but most levers in the human body are third class.", "There are numerous third-class levers in the human body; one example can be illustrated in the elbow joint (figure 1.23b). The joint is the axis (fulcrum). The resistance (weight) is the forearm, wrist, and hand. The force is the biceps muscle when the elbow is flexed.", "## Mechanical Advantage in Biomechanics\n\nIt may seem confusing that most of the muscles in the human body are 3rd class levers, since these levers are at a mechanical disadvantage in terms of effort versus load. However, this only holds true in terms of resistance. The opposite is true when you consider the distal lever displacement. A small arc of motion proximally at the muscle insertion will create large angular displacement and velocity distally. Since most human movement is aimed at maximizing angular displacement of a distal segment through space, the use of 3rd class levers for is very efficient.\n\nThis creates a relationship between the lever arm distance, distal angular displacement/velocity, and torque production. The shorter the lever arm of the effort force (decreased mechanical advantage), the greater angular displacement and angular velocity of the distal end of the lever for a given arc of displacement of the effort force. The larger the lever arm of the effort force (increased mechanical advantage), the increased torque production.\n\nThis lever arm and force/torque production relationship needs to be taken into consideration when assessing movement and prescribing interventions. For example, applying a 5 pound weight at the distal end of a lever during a scaption/SLR exercise creates a mechanical disadvantage for the supraspinatus/illiopsoas.
