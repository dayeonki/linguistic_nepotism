At a time when Christopher Columbus was enslaving Native Americans and claiming their lands and work for his own, the word became a slur used by white Europeans to describe Native American people. The usage stuck around for hundreds of years, and it’s still a word that many indigenous peoples around the world find offensive."]}

These toxins can cause respiratory problems, allergic reactions and illness. George says aflatoxin, a specific type mycotoxin found in nuts and grains, can even be cancer-causing.\n\n\nMold is usually easy to spot. It often appears as a blue or green discoloration, which can grow a hairy coat if left long enough, Kirkpatrick says. If you’re examining foods in jars—things like pasta sauce or salsa—it’s best to check the underside of the lid and rim of the container for suspicious growths.\n\n\nJust don’t sniff your foods, Kirkpatrick warns, which could lead to you inhaling mold spores. If you’re worried about mold but don’t see any growths, use common sense. “If the food doesn’t look the way it normally would, and especially if it seems moisture-soaked, toss it,” Kirkpatrick says.\n\n\nThe exceptions: Hard block cheeses like parmesan, cheddar or Swiss. “With those, the mold generally won’t penetrate deep into the product,” Kirkpatrick says. But don’t start scraping, which can release mold spores into the air or allow them to spread to your countertops or other foods. The only safe way to remove that mold is to cut away an inch of cheese all the way around the spot, she says. “You’ll probably cut away some safe parts, but that’s a good rule of thumb.”"]}

The cerebellum performs a variety of functions, like the regulation of timing and motor movement (via UT Health). Because of this, our brains are able to anticipate our next move before we make it. A study conducted by researchers at Queen's University found that self-administered physical stimuli were less perceived by the brain than stimuli administered to participants from an external source (via Science Daily). This occurrence is known as sensory attenuation and results in our brain deactivating our own tickle response.\n\n\nTry as we might, it's not possible to outsmart our own brains. Tickling serves a specific physical purpose when it comes to detecting danger, but it also plays a role in our emotions as well. Studies have found that the same part of our brain is stimulated when we're tickled as when we hear a funny joke. Therefore, tickling can serve multiple purposes — as long as we don't see it coming.", "We aren't aware of a lot of the sensations generated by our movements. For example, you probably don't pay much attention to your vocal cords when you speak. For the same reason, we can't tickle ourselves. If we grab our sides in an attempt to tickle ourselves, our brain anticipates this contact from the hands and prepares itself for it. By taking away the feeling of unease and panic, the body no longer responds the same as it would if someone else were to tickle us.\n\n\nBrain scientists at the University College London have pinpointed the cerebellum as the part of the brain that prevents us from self-tickling. The cerebellum is the region located at the base of the brain that monitors our movements. It can distinguish expected sensations from unexpected sensations. An expected sensation would be the amount of pressure your fingers apply to your keyboard while typing. An unexpected sensation would be someone sneaking up behind you and tapping you on the shoulder. While the brain discards the sensation of typing, it pays a lot of attention to someone tapping on your shoulder. The difference in reactions from expected to unexpected is a built-in response that probably developed in early human history to detect predators.", "Masturbation is the self-stimulation of the genitals to achieve sexual arousal and pleasure, usually to the point of orgasm (sexual climax)."]}

The requirements for gaining these permits are stipulated at the state level. There must also be a public review period, which is often contentious. All permits must be obtained prior to beginning exploration, or the applicant may face delays and financial and legal penalties.

Wallace suggested that the bright colors worn by reef fish may actually help them hide in an equally colorful environment. While fish are pink and green and purple and blue, so are the corals, sponges and other parts of the visually complex background behind them. “He said, well, these colors might actually have a protective function — they might actually function like camouflage in a sense against these heterogeneous backgrounds,” Rosenthal says.", "The other idea is one developed by biologist Konrad Lorenz in the mid-20th century. He suggested that fish are conspicuously colored to help them identify their own species in the crowded reef environment, where there is direct competition between not only other species, but also members of their own.\n\n\nConsequently, colors may allow for individual recognition. Even with some reef fish’s intricate color pattern, no two are exactly alike. In his research on cleaner fish in the Indo-Pacific region, Lorenz studied striped cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus). While he couldn’t tag the little fish, he could photograph them and tell the difference between individuals by their markings in photographs. “If we can, you can bet they can,” he says.\n\n\nBy having “iconically different” color patterns, Rosenthal says, fish are able to minimize the costs of aggression — in other words, if you’re different from everyone you’re not competing with, you’re not going to have a lot of inter-species conflict that would sap your energy.", "One of the ways they’ve done it is to use light conditions to communicate signals — mating, camouflage and territory — in a context that matches the clarity of the water.\n\n\n“What this means is that fish on a reef in the Caribbean near the surface, can basically use color information and fine spatial information to encode species identity,” Rosenthal says. “In the Pacific, you don’t have that luxury anymore, because there’s not as much light, and there’s not as much fidelity of spatial information.”"]}

This means that the last parts of the ice cube to crystallize end up with most of the impurities. If you’ll take a look at your home made ice cubes, you’ll note that the parts of the ice cube that were at the bottom of the tray are the milky colored bits. That’s because those were the last parts to freeze. The ice cubes in your tray froze from the top downward, which pushed the contaminant air downward until it was trapped at the bottom and had nowhere else to go.", "The most common impurities found in tap water include lime (also known as limescale), calcium, fluoride, nitrates, magnesium and certain other organic elements that are practically impossible to remove with regular filtration methods. So, when water freezes, the impurities that were evenly distributed in the water, tend to congregate near the middle, making ice cubes the whitest at their center.", "The main reason is that the (hopefully) crystal-clear water you pour into the ice trays is not as pure as it seems, containing small amounts of (hopefully) harmless suspended minerals and sediment.\n\n\nBecause all objects freeze from the outside in, the center of the cube is the last to solidify. Water free of minerals and impurities freezes first, pushing the cloudy parts containing the sediment (and tiny trapped air bubbles) toward the center. The result is a harmless (but not particularly photogenic) ice cube clouding."]}

In astigmatism, the cornea has a curvature imperfection, or the lens is distorted, resulting in both near and far objects appearing blurry.", "Reading lenses are rated in diopters, a formula opticians use. Manufacturers of reading glasses often contribute to consumer confusion by referring to magnification power and diopter strength interchangeably. They are not the same thing. But it’s easier for people to understand magnification than the science of lenses.\n\nA slightly more technical explanation. With every power option, or “diopter”, there is a sweet spot range where close vision is brought into sharp focus. This changes from person to person. If the diopter is too weak for your individual needs, you will need to move the material farther away from your face to see it clearly. If the diopter is too strong, that range of sweet spot will be closer than you prefer. The average person reads material between 14 - 18 inches away from their face. If you would like to restore a comfortable reading range that is within that, find a diopter that sharpens focus in this range. In contrast, if you are working at your desk and your computer monitor is 24 inches away, you will need a weaker power than you would for reading."]}

The same kind of phenomena occurs when you take ice cream out of the freezer - you see frost on the outside of the container. In this case the cup (or ice cream container) is below the freezing point of water.

When milk is heated rapidly, some of the water in it evaporates from the surface. This exposes proteins and fat molecules, which bind and dry out as warming continues. Skin most commonly forms when milk is heated over a stove top, as stoves are generally capable of reaching very high temperatures quite quickly, though it can happen in the microwave as well. The film is not harmful, but is distasteful to many and can be prevented with constant stirring and a close eye on temperature.", "It is often surprising to see a film or skin on nonfat or “skim” milk, since it would seem that, without fat, the proteins would have nothing to bind to. In truth, it is rare to encounter milk that is truly fat free. Most of the skim milk that is sold commercially has very low fat content, but is rarely ever truly fat-free. Even trace amounts of fat on the surface can contribute to skin formation.\n\n\nA similar phenomenon happens with soy milk, which is generally marketed as fat free. Natural fats still occur in trace amounts, and can be drawn to the surface when exposed to very high temperatures. Soy film can be discarded, but is also considered a delicacy in many Asian cultures. When removed and dried, it is referred to as yuba, or soybean curd, which is used in a variety of recipes.", "Milk skin or lactoderm refers to a sticky film of protein that forms on top of dairy milk and foods containing dairy milk (such as hot chocolate and some soups). Milk film can be produced both through conventional boiling and by microwaving the liquid, and as such can often be observed when heating milk for use in drinks such as drinking chocolate. It is caused by the denaturation of proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin (whey protein). The thickness of the skin varies dependent on a number of factors, including the temperature of the milk, the shape of the container, and the amount of milk in the container.\n\n\nWhen milk is boiled, soluble milk proteins are denatured and then coagulate with milk's fat and form a sticky film across the top of the liquid, which then dries by evaporation. The layer does not need to be discarded and can be consumed, as protein's nutritional value is unaffected by the denaturation process.

So people who recall dreams may have a difference in their ability to memorize things in general.\n\n\nBeyond that, a person’s brain may actually block out a dream so we don’t remember it the following day. “The dream activity can be so real and intense that our brains actually hide, or mask away the dream, so [it doesn’t] get lost between our waking experience, and our dream lives. Thus it is normal to forget dreams, most of the time.” Dimitriu says.", "A study published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology and reported by International Business Times suggested that those people who reported high dream recall had more activity in the temporoparietal junction than those who didn’t recall their dreams often.\n\n\nLambert tells Healthline that if someone consistently doesn’t get enough sleep, the amount of REM sleep they experience will drop, making it harder for them to remember their dreams the following day.\n\n\nEven personality traits can be an indicator of whether someone will be able to remember their dreams.\n\n\nLambert continues: “Researchers also looked at the most common personality traits that are presented in people who can recall their dreams. Overall, such people are prone to daydreaming, creative thinking, and introspection. At the same time, those who are more practical and focused on what is outside themselves tend to have difficulty remembering their dreams.”\n\n\nThis may mean that some people are naturally more likely to recall their dreams than others, despite their quality of sleep.\n\n\nOther factors, like stress or experiencing a trauma, can also cause people to have vivid dreams or nightmares that they’re more likely to recall the next day. For example, a person who’s coping with grief after losing a loved one may dream about the death in elaborate detail. Remembering the dream the next day may affect mood and cause even more stress or anxiety.", "People who have the ability to recall their dreams five mornings per week, on average, have more spontaneous activity occurring in certain parts of their brains than others. The parts of the brain that host these increased levels of activity are called the temporo-parietal junction, which is an information-processing hub, and the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for the expression of personality as well as the planning of complex cognitive behaviors. And, interestingly, this escalation in liveliness is higher during both wakefulness and sleep, so says a study of 41 people recently published online February 19 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology. The activity in the brains of the people in this study were measured by Positron Emission Tomography while they were awake and sleeping. What do these findings tell us?\n\n\nIn combination with previous research from one of the study’s authors, Perrine Ruby, the findings tell us why some people remember their dreams and some do not. Ruby co-authored related research that was published last year in the journal Cerebral Cortex, which showed that people who have the ability to regularly recall their dreams are also more reactive to sounds when they are both asleep and awake. Ruby made some comments in a recent statement that synthesized the findings for both of these studies. Ruby stated that the brain needs to awaken from sleep in order to memorize new information. This, said Ruby, may explain the reason that those who react more to environmental stimuli can remember their dreams better; they simply are awakened more often and can therefore better encode into memory their dreams than others who are less reactive to sounds. In addition, the researchers said that people who often recall their dreams may also have more dreams than “low-recall” dreamers."]}

So they developed a secret “super policy” for bypassing Secure Boot completely.

Is it an elaborate marketing scheme to get you to spend more?\n\nWell, essentially…yes. But there’s really nothing “elaborate” about it; it’s actually pretty simple. “It’s a type of psychological pricing,” says Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. “Because we read from left to right, we pay less attention to the end of the number versus the beginning.” This is especially effective if you’re just quickly perusing several prices in a row; the first number will definitely stand out to you more. Psychological pricing is powerful, but luckily, there are also plenty of psychology tricks to help you spend less while shopping.\n\nOf course, we still know that $9.99 is basically ten dollars, not nine dollars. But the $.99 trick takes advantage of the way our brains process prices. When we see a price of $9.99, we associate it as part of the $9–$9.99 “range” rather than the $10–$10.99 “range.” “Consumers don’t want to transcend a certain category, so even a penny less may make a huge psychological difference,” explains Subimal Chatterjee, Distinguished Teaching Professor of Marketing at Binghamton University School of Management.", "Ending a price in .99 is based on the theory that, because we read from left to right, the first digit of the price resonates with us the most, Hibbett explained.

Mechanical processes, such as roasting, chopping and grinding play a role because they disrupt the cell wall of almonds and affect particle size. Particle size is also affected when almonds are chewed and digested in the body. The larger the particle size, the less the almond is broken down by digestive enzymes and the more of the almond is excreted, so fewer calories are absorbed. The reverse is also true: the smaller the particle size, the more calories are absorbed.

However, the main optical principle at work, and one that is quite fascinating, is called the “pinhole effect”. Clear vision is a result of light rays that properly focused on the retina located in the back of the eye. Typically, this is done with glasses or contact lenses; both of which bend light into focus and therefore correct vision.\n\n\nWhen we squint it creates the same effect as looking through a pinhole. Basically only a small amount of focused central light rays are allowed into the eye. This prevents the unfocused light rays in the periphery from reaching the retina. The result is better vision. Photographers understand this as “depth of field”.", "The reason that squinting helps you see is because it changes the shape of your eye, making the pupil smaller, thus letting less light in and making an image clear. This is similar to the way a larger aperture works; a smaller hole in your camera lets less light in, with better focus.", "By limiting the rays of light that come in through the bottom and top of the pupil, squinting allows rays to pass closer to the center of the lens, thereby creating a more focused image.

The solar system formed from a giant cloud of gas and particles (literally stardust--the remains of a star that had exploded) billions of years ago. The \"dust\" clumped together to form the planets. Some of the leftover dust formed the moons of the planets (although the origin of Earth's moon is still up for debate). Some of this dust was too close to the planet to form stable moons, and instead formed rings. It is likely that large rings couldn't form on inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) because the rings are made of frozen icy dust, and the sun is too hot this close to it for the rings to form.", "“There are various theories about planetary rings, like the fantastic rings around Saturn, but we cannot say for sure how they are formed,” explains Lattis.\n\n\nOne theory is that the rings formed at the same time as the planet and its major moons. In this case, if material is close to the planet, the planet’s gravitational pull is too strong to coalesce into a moon and the particles that would otherwise form a moon spread out in orbit around the planet as a ring.\n\n\nAnother idea is that a close call by a moon or comet results in the planet’s gravitational tidal force breaking up those bodies, the debris of which then becomes a ring system.", "The larger volume of space and lower gravity of the Sun in the giant-planet region allowed Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to form like solar systems in miniature. We think each of them pulled in lots of material and had a disk of gas, dust, and ice surrounding it during formation. Any dust and ice not incorporated into the planet itself would have coalesced into the regular moons we see today around the giant planets. These satellites are in nearly circular orbits near the equators of their host planets, such as the four Galilean satellites around Jupiter and Titan around Saturn, which are all composed of large fractions of ice.\n\n\nBecause the giant planets gravitationally dominate a very large area, they also can efficiently capture passing objects as moons, which we call irregular satellites. These irregular moons are relatively small and have orbits with large inclinations, eccentricities, and semimajor axes.\n\n\nIn contrast, the terrestrial planets formed much closer to the Sun with much less material around them. They grew slowly by accreting many small rocky planetesimals and never grew massive enough to capture a disk of gas and dust. Earth’s Moon probably formed through a direct collision. Any large object striking a planet would have thrown material off the world into orbit, allowing it to coalesce into a moon."]}

The question of how it manages to do so in the absence of a medium is explained by the nature of electromagnetic vibrations. When a charged particle vibrates, it produces an electrical vibration that automatically induces a magnetic one -- physicists often visualize these vibrations occurring in perpendicular planes. The paired oscillations propagate outward from the source; no medium, except for the electromagnetic field that permeates the universe, is required to conduct them.", "When I say \"waves of electric and magnetic fields,\" I'm talking about something similar to the waves in the rope. Similar to wiggling the end of the rope, we can change the electric or magnetic field at one point, and that disturbance travels away from us. (One way to change the magnetic field at a point is to hold a magnet there, then wiggle it back and forth.) Unlike the wave in the rope, these waves actually travel away from us in all directions. It turns out that in a vacuum, for example in outer space, these waves travel at exactly the speed of light! It doesn't matter how rapidly the fields wiggle back and forth, they will always travel at the same speed. (In air, the waves go ever so slightly slower than in vacuum, and in glass, they can go only about two-thirds as fast as they would in vacuum, but this is not important right now. From now on, when I talk about the speed of light, I mean the speed of light in a vacuum, and I'm talking about waves traveling in a vacuum.) The conclusion that physicists have drawn from this result is that light consists of waves of electric and magnetic fields. This is a fascinating result: that we learn something about light by studying magnets and electrical currents.", "In contrast, light waves can travel through a vacuum, and do not require a medium. In empty space, the wave does not dissipate (grow smaller) no matter how far it travels, because the wave is not interacting with anything else. This is why light from distant stars can travel through space for billions of light-years and still reach us on earth. However, light can also travel within some materials, like glass and water. In this case, some light is absorbed and lost as heat, just like sound.

McKenzie compares it to holding your thumb over a garden hose: “Blocking part of the hose [increases] the pressure of the water inside, [causing] the water leaving to spray out at an even greater velocity.” When you start to pump gas, the pipe, which has been “blocked” like the hose, releases the air quickly. “This expelled air brings with it a pressure that’s strong enough to hold the valve in the open position,” McKenzie says.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that’s what happens while you’re filling up your tank.

Fast-forward another 70,000 years and early man has recognized the value of sharpened flint, not only good for striking fire, but also for delicately slicing off hair from the body!\n\n[Image: not only do i keep my face smooth but i also built this computer meme]\n\nThe real history of shaving, however, doesn’t begin until we reach the Egyptian civilization, where the act of shaving made its real debut on the world stage. Egyptians had a powerful belief that body hair was a sign of uncleanliness, so both men and women engaged in the complete removal of hair from the body—head to toe! In some cases, caustic ingredients like quicklime and arsenic were used in these primitive depilatory creams and shaving lotions. Early razors also appeared around the time, with the rise in metalworking and mining in many areas of the world. The Egyptian relationship to cleanliness and body hair bordered on the obsessive, and the upper classes often bathed multiple times per day. They would shave their heads completely bald, and then design cooling wigs to wear out in public.\n\nThe fear of uncleanliness was a real concern, and may have been the early reason for prehistoric man to shave as well. Body hair provides an ideal environment for lice and other unwanted critters, and can also be a breeding ground for fungal infections, particularly in hot or humid weather. Egyptians attempted to eliminate the risk of pests or pathogens by removing any environment where they could thrive! Furthermore, in the hot and humid weather of Egypt, having an excess of body hair led to the much faster development of body odor, another sign of uncleanliness within the rigid Egyptian society.", "The Egyptians were probably the first people to follow a dedicated shaving regimen to combat the hot climate and ward off lice and other pests, and over time, a lack of hair—on both the head and the body—was denoted as a status symbol (affluent Egyptians would often employ full-time barbers to maintain cleanliness)."]}

The group reports that, in the U.S., desalinated water costs at least five times as much to harvest as other sources of fresh water. Similar high costs are a big hurdle to desalination efforts in poor countries as well, where limited funds are already stretched too thin.\n\nOn the environmental front, widespread desalination could take a heavy toll on ocean biodiversity. \"Ocean water is filled with living creatures, and most of them are lost in the process of desalination,\" says Sylvia Earle, one of the world's foremost marine biologists and a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence. “Most are microbial, but intake pipes to desalination plants also take up the larvae of a cross-section of life in the sea, as well as some fairly large organisms…part of the hidden cost of doing business,” she says.", "Water obtained from desalination costs twice the amount of water from freshwater sources.

It is a proven method for potable drinking water. * Countries are less dependent on natural resources which can now begin replenishing via the water cycle. * Even better, the process of RO purification of waste from industries can give safe water that can be used to refill the aquifer, lakes, reservoirs of the region and in turn lifting stress from the environment.\n\nPlants have been set across the world in Australia, U.S, Saudi Arabia and more where each day tens of thousands of gallons of freshwater are produced from an endless supply of the sea.\n\n“It is a growing trend.

The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce who developed heliography and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.[3][4] Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, airbrushing, or scratching Polaroids during developing (Polaroid art).[5] Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the darkroom by piecing photos or negatives together. Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash-out parts of the photograph, or hand coloring for aesthetic purposes or to mimic a fine art painting.[6]", "In a 2013 blog post for Fstoppers, professional retoucher Pratik Naik described the painstaking process as such:\n\n\n“Need to zoom into a photo?

Eager to please potential customers, photographers immediately resorted to manual intervention, enlivening their pictures with powdered pigment, watercolor and oil paint.\n\n\nEarly photography was color-blind in other ways as well. In the 19th century, photographic emulsions were much more sensitive to blue and violet light than to other colors on the spectrum, which meant that blue skies almost always appeared blotchy and overexposed. To overcome the problem, many landscape photographers would make two separate negatives — one exposed for the land, the other for the sky — and print them together on a single sheet of paper. The French photographer Gustave Le Gray used this technique in his majestic seascapes of the 1850s. The exhibition features three seascapes by Le Gray, all using the same cloud negative. The show also includes a great pair of before-and-after landscapes by the American photographer Carleton Watkins — one with a blank white sky, the other with added clouds."]}

If the door went all the way to the floor, other occupants might not be able to notice if someone in a stall was having a problem and lost consciousness. The gap provides visibility in case a person inside is in some kind of distress. It also helps first responders, who could pull the occupant out without having to break down the door.\n\n\nA gap also provides just enough of a dent in privacy to make any kind of undesirable public behavior—like sexual activity or drug use—less practical.\n\n\nThere are economical and logistical considerations, too. Doors that come only part of the way down are universal, meaning that suppliers and installers don’t need to custom-measure them. This saves on costs. Small doors also make cleaning floors in and around the stalls easier. This was the motivation behind the partitions famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed for the influential Larkin Building that stood in Buffalo, New York, from 1903 to 1950. Many of his ideas, like small bathroom doors, became a standard of business construction.\n\n\nIf you’re still not convinced gaps are a design win, consider that an enclosed stall is going to have only limited air circulation. The last thing you want or need in a public bathroom is to trap odors. It also helps keep loitering to a minimum. (Then again, so would the stench.)", "Easier to Clean: By having a gap at the bottom, bathroom partitions are much easier to clean, as is the whole restroom. You can hose down or even powerwash a restroom that has partitions with gaps at the bottom because the water has somewhere to run even if there’s not a drain in a given stall.\n* Emergency Access: If someone loses consciousness in a fully enclosed bathroom, it may take hours for someone to notice. If this happens in a stall with a gap at the bottom, the odds are good someone will notice much quicker, which is important in instances where every second can mean the difference between life and death. Instead of having to break down the door, a first responder can crawl through the gap at the bottom of the partition and unlock the door to render help.\n* Deterrent to Undesirable Behavior: Because people can partially see into a bathroom stall that has a gap at the bottom, this type of partition is a natural deterrent to undesirable behavior, such as someone spray painting the stall with graffiti.\n* More Affordable: Partitions that don’t extend from the floor to the ceiling don’t have to be custom made to fit a room’s exact measurements and they don’t require as many materials to construct. This makes them considerably more affordable.\n* Better Air Circulation: Better air circulation is one of the top reasons why there are gaps under toilet stalls. While restrooms with this kind of partition may still get a bit stinky from time to time, things would be even more overwhelming in a fully enclosed stall.\n* Keeps the Line Moving: Having a gap at the base of a partition allows people waiting in line to see if a stall is occupied or vacant. This visibility keeps the line moving and prevents wait times from being any longer than they have to be. When a stall isn’t fully enclosed, people often feel like they have to take care of their business even faster, which also helps keep the line moving.\n* ADA Compliance: Space is needed to allow for easier maneuverability for patrons in a wheelchair.

After all, sleep is when we’re most defenseless, so our brain really doesn’t want to ‘switch off’ when there’s what seems like potential danger.", "White noise can help this. Let’s say that the car horn is a 70 decibel sound. If you’re lying in almost complete silence, maybe with a little wind outside, that’s around 20 decibels. That sudden 50 decibel jump is HUGE, and will totally spring you awake. Instead, if you have a white noise generator or are playing white noise from your speakers/laptop, this could be a nice, continuous sound at around 50 decibels (just about the level of normal conversation). Suddenly, that same 70 decibel car noise is only a 20 decibel jump. It’s much less noticeable, and so much less likely to shock you into being jolted awake.", "Reactions to sounds during sleep can be influenced by meaning and significance. Sounds indicating possible danger—even very quiet sounds, like the opening of a door—often will easily wake a sleeping person. Hearing their children cry usually causes parents to wake almost instantly. These responses to noise are highly individual, and a sign of how deeply engaged the brain remains to external stimuli during sleep."]}

So, by buying all the juice available now, when the shortage is revealed, everyone will have to buy it off of them at inflated prices. Louis and Billy Ray, on the other hand, know that there is plenty of juice available, and begin selling contracts at the high price the Dukes have created.

In fact, they have already made a loss, but if they can sell the juice that they have bought, then they might be able to make back a little of their money. Because the other traders are frantically selling, Louis and Billy Ray can buy very cheaply all the orange juice they need in order to fulfil the contracts they have already made. If they weren’t able to buy the juice they needed, they would default on their promised deliveries, leaving them owing potentially millions of dollars.

And of course: rigged insider information. This is the most important piece of the puzzle. Short-selling can only be fully efficient if you know the price will go down. Then you can scam everyone else easily.\n\n\nThe insider information I'm referring to is the Dept of Agriculture crop report for oranges (they're trading a commodity - frozen orange juice). The Dukes hired their secret agent Mr Beeks to get them the report before anyone else sees it. Unfortunately for them, Winthorpe and Valentine get their hands on the report before the Dukes do and feed them false information. The Dukes are led to believe that the weather was bad and so the harvest was less than normal. Therefore the Dukes are expecting high prices (low supply + high demand = high prices). However the actual report signals the opposite - the harvest was unaffected by the bad weather, and the supply will be plentiful. Hence the scope for short-selling, as Winthorpe and Valentine know that the price is likely to go down."]}

Typically you don’t want to use soft wheels when performing tricks because the board can possibly bounce back up after the wheels hit the pavement. It makes it much more difficult to land tricks and remain stable.\n\nThe trucks of skateboards and longboards are also different.

On a skateboard, you'll see more of a curve on its nose and tail to make it easier to land tricks and flips.\n\nIt should be no surprise that longboards are, of course, longer. They can be as long as 59 inches, while the typical skateboard is around 36 inches. Here's where it gets confusing: longboards also come in sizes as small as 28 inches long. If the length trips you up, just remember the key difference between the two is that longboards are flat and skateboards curve.

This makes landing a trick unstable and more chances of landing primo (both feet on the side of the deck).\n\nSkateboards have smaller trucks, longboards have wider trucks and have a different design.

In some cases, these weather modifiers were trying to produce rain in drought-afflicted areas, mitigate hail damage by preventing hailstones from growing so large, or disperse fog banks around airports. Many proprietors of this new technology made audacious claims about their cloud seeding services. Unfortunately, hard science could never substantiate the claims. If anything, rigorous experimentation seemed to suggest that cloud seeding barely worked or, worse, didn't work at all.\n\nStill, enough tantalizing evidence has accumulated over the years to keep interest in weather modification alive. For example, research conducted in South Africa and Mexico has shown that seeding warm rain clouds with salt particles -- what is known as hygroscopic seeding -- is more effective than seeding cold rain clouds with silver iodide.

Let’s begin by taking a look at what HTTPS and SSL stand for.\n\nHTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, meaning that the communication between your visitor and your website is secure and encrypted.\n\nThere are a number of benefits to having an HTTPS website over a standard HTTP, especially if your visitor is frequently entering detailed or sensitive information when they visit your site. If your customer needs to enter credit card information or other personal information, you’ll want to have an HTTPS page.\n\nHaving an HTTPS shows your visitor that you’re a valid company, so they don’t need to be worried about entering credit card information to make a purchase online. The information they do enter will become encrypted, so it cannot be stolen or intercepted.\n\nYour HTTPS website can establish a stronger level of trust with your customer. When they know that their information is protected, they’ll be more likely to purchase from your company over your competition.\n\n## What is SSL?\n\nSSL, which stands for Secure Socket Layer, works with your HTTPS website to protect your customer’s information and privacy. SSL, which may also be called TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is the encryption communication that your HTTPS website will use to encrypt the information a customer or client puts into your website.", "Both SSH and SSL are public-key cryptography protocols that create a secure, confidential exchange of data and connection across the Internet. Let’s discuss some of the major key differences:\n\n 1. Usually, SSH uses Port 22, whereas SSL uses Port 443. 2. SSH uses a username/password authentication process to establish a secure connection, whereas SSL does not consider it. 3. SSH is based on network tunnelling, whereas SSL is based on certificates. 4. SSL is used for securely transmitting critical information like credit cards and banking. Whereas SSH is used for securely executing commands across the Internet. 5. SSL is used for encrypting communication between browser and server. On the other hand, SSH is used for encrypting communication between two computers over the Internet. 6. In SSL, the communication is authenticated via the private-key/public-key pair. Whereas in SSH, the communication is authenticated via private-key/public-key pair or username/password pair. 7. Technically, SSH is for securing computer networks, whereas SSL is for securing online data transfers. 8. SSL generally (except exceptions) uses X.509 digital certificates for server and client authentication processes, whereas SSH does not. 9. Another major difference is that SSH has more built-in functionality than SSL. It helps in enabling users to log in to a server and execute commands remotely, whereas SSL does not have this functionality. To achieve this functionality, you need to pair it with another protocol like HTTP, FTP."]}

Until recently, most neuroscientists believed that this latter type of temporal processing – the kind that alerts you when you’ve lingered over breakfast for too long – is supported by a single brain system. However, emerging research indicates that the model of a single neural clock might be too simplistic. A new study, recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience by neuroscientists at the University of California, Irvine, reveals that the brain may in fact have a second method for sensing elapsed time. What’s more, the authors propose that this second internal clock not only works in parallel with our primary neural clock, but may even compete with it.\n\n\nPast research suggested that a brain region called the striatum lies at the heart of our central inner clock, working with the brain’s surrounding cortex to integrate temporal information.", "According to Bejan—who reviewed previous studies in a range of fields on time, vision, cognition, and mental processing to reach his conclusion—time as we experience it represents perceived changes in mental stimuli. It’s related to what we see. As physical mental-image processing time and the rapidity of images we take in changes, so does our perception of time. And in some sense, each of us has our own “mind time” unrelated to the passing of hours, days, and years on clocks and calendars, which is affected by the amount of rest we get and other factors.", "It has also been shown that the cerebellum plays a key role in motor tasks requiring perception of implicit timing. Other parts of the brain may be involved in implicit-timing estimates: for example, the left parietal cortex, which manages intended movement, and the left premotor cortex, which plans and organises movement. Sometimes the right prefrontal cortex, usually involved in explicit-timing estimates, is activated for implicit estimates, for instance, when an event does not occur as soon as expected: a traffic light stays red for longer than foreseen. The brain updates its time forecasts, once again anticipating the interval.\n\n\nIn addition, \"the regions of the brain involved differ depending on the context, particularly if the stimulus only lasts for a very short time, less than 200 milliseconds,\" says Coull. The visual cortex is activated when we estimate the duration of a visual stimulus. In the same way, the primary motor cortex comes into play when a timing estimate is associated with an action, whereas the auditory cortex has a part in estimating the length of a sound stimulus.\n\n\nAbove all, the brain's perception of time involves processes linked to memory and attention: witness the impression that time is passing more quickly when we are busy, or doing something amusing or exciting. Time flies even when we are in love. In contrast, a watched pot never boils. Minutes drag by when we are bored."]}

(www.science20.com)", "Balancing on a Bicycle: The Phenomena (www.mentalfloss.com)"], "pos_context_en": ["Since the bicycle was invented, s cientists have postulated various reasons as to why a bicycle is self stable above a certain speed. The consensus has been that a bicycle's stability is related to two factors: First, the rotating wheels of the bicycle provide stability through gyroscopic effects; secondly, that the ‘trail’, the distance by which the contact point of the front wheel trails behind the steering axis, plays an important part.\n\nA new study in Science claims to have settled the issue - gyroscopic effects and trail help, says researcher Dr Arend Schwab of the 3mE faculty at TU Delft, but are not necessary above a certain speed . In a 2007 Proceedings of the Royal Society article (doi:10.1098/rspa.2007.1857), a mathematical model with around 25 physical parameters was developed at the time which appeared to predict whether, and at what speeds, a particular design of bicycle would be stable.", "A bicycle, on the other hand, is statically unstable because it only has two contact points with the ground (whatever portion of the front and back wheels happen to be touching the ground) and its base of support is a line segment. A good base of support needs at least three contact points with the ground, so bikes are hard to keep upright when they're still. Bikes are, however, dynamically stable, or stable when moving forward, because steering allows a rider to move the bike's points of support around under the center of gravity and keep it balanced, often with steering adjustments small enough that the rider may not even realize they're making them. It's sort of like standing on one foot. If you don't hop around a little, and you start falling sideways, you can't recover and you fall over. If you do hop, though, you can move your foot around to keep your center of gravity above it and keep your balance.\n\n\nA bike has two features that help this dynamic stability immensely: its wheels. Spinning wheels have angular momentum, and when you're sitting on a bike, you and it and its wheels make up a system that obeys the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Unless torque, or twisting force, is applied from outside the system to change the wheels' angular momentum, that momentum and the direction of the momentum remain constant. In a nutshell, once the wheels line up a certain way, they want to stay lined up like that. It's easy for you to move them, but hard for an outside force to do the same, and so the bike is easy to keep balanced but doesn't topple easily. A non-moving bike has wheels that aren't spinning and zero angular momentum, which makes it very easy for external torque to change the wheels' direction, making the bike harder to balance."]}

It is interesting to study the history of cartography because it very graphically shows the corresponding improvements in navigation over time.\n\n\nIn order to make an accurate map, you need to know first where you are making your observations from. Making the observations from a previously known position will result in much greater accuracy. This position may have been established by an earlier survey (eg, working from a known point on an existing map) or by being able to independently figure out your position with good certainty on the position of the globe.", "The problem was the portolan mapmakers’ lack of a systematic way of reducing the spherical Earth to a flat map. That was of little consequence for short journeys but mattered much more when sailing longer distances. In 1569, the Belgian geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator created his method for presenting a spherical world on a flat map, the one familiar to us today. This mapmaking technique, though it stretched and compressed landmarks and distances between them, had the great advantage that a straight compass course was represented by a straight line on the map.\n\n\nMercator’s projections began to be used to sail the open seas by the early 1800s, by which time portolan charts had pretty much disappeared. But their importance is undeniable. “The development of these maps revolutionized how people perceived space, much like Google Earth has done in our lifetimes,” Hessler says. “Understanding how the technology was developed gives us insight into how we got here, and perhaps into where we’re going.”"]}

It appears they used neither a regular formula nor continuous direct observation to determine the length of the months. Most likely, they followed a general rule of alternating months (29 and 30 days long), subject to periodic correction by observation.\n\nIn addition to this calendar, which has been called the festival calendar, Athenians maintained a second calendar for the political year. This \"conciliar\" year divided the year into \"prytanies,\" one for each of the \"phylai,\" the subdivisions of Athenian citizens. The number of phylai, and hence the number of prytanies, varies over time. Until 307 BCE, there were 10 phylai.\n\nAfter that the number varies between 11 and 13 (usually 12). Even more confusing, while the conciliar and festival years were basically the same length in the 4th century BCE, such was not regularly the case earlier or later. Thus documents dated by prytany are frequently very difficult to assign to a particular equivalent in the Julian calendar, although we are usually secure in assigning an approximate date", "Ancient historians date by Olympiad by giving both the number of the Olympiad and the year within the cycle, 1-4 (the Olympiad itself was held on year 1).

We do not actually need to believe an actual festival was held on this date, but when Greek historians are writing in later times, they date their own events using this as the epoch. We can establish a precise correlation to the common era from a variety of different sources, but the most definitive comes from a passage in Diodorus, where he dates the year of a total solar eclipse to the reign of the Athenian archon Hieromnemon, which he also gives as Ol. 117,3.

As time went on, dentistry (and ophthalmology, to some degree) was regarded as less advanced than medicine, which seeped into the minds of Congress while they formulated public health insurance policies in the 1960s.

Instead of cramming everything in together like sardines to save space, heirlooms, artifacts and artwork may actually benefit from extra space.\n\n\nIf there’s any chance that friction or contact could damage a museum piece it’s placed in a crate or special packaging. Museums have even had to construct mounts, trays and supports to stabilize artifacts before they’re moved. When that’s not possible, the item is adequately secured in place and given plenty of room in the moving truck.\n\n\n### Special Packaging for Documents\n\n\nEven the documentation that authenticates a historical artifact or art piece is a vital item that has to be handled and packed with care. When you’re moving files moisture is again a top concern, but physical damage can also easily occur if documents aren’t packaged appropriately.\n\n\nFile boxes are designed to securely hold thousands of letter or legal size documents.

An example of this class of lever is a baseball bat. The handle of the bat is the fulcrum, you supply the input force near the middle, and the other end of the bat that pushes the ball with the output forces. In a third-class lever, the input force is greater than the output force but the output load is able to move farther.\n\n[Image: Examples of Levers]\n\nYou have several third-class levers in your body. One that is easy to investigate is your forearm.", "Bones, ligaments, and muscles are the structures that form levers in the body to create human movement. In simple terms, a joint (where two or more bones join together) forms the axis (or fulcrum), and the muscles crossing the joint apply the force to move a weight or resistance. Levers are typically labeled as first class, second class, or third class. All three types are found in the body, but most levers in the human body are third class.", "There are numerous third-class levers in the human body; one example can be illustrated in the elbow joint (figure 1.23b). The joint is the axis (fulcrum). The resistance (weight) is the forearm, wrist, and hand. The force is the biceps muscle when the elbow is flexed.", "## Mechanical Advantage in Biomechanics\n\nIt may seem confusing that most of the muscles in the human body are 3rd class levers, since these levers are at a mechanical disadvantage in terms of effort versus load. However, this only holds true in terms of resistance. The opposite is true when you consider the distal lever displacement. A small arc of motion proximally at the muscle insertion will create large angular displacement and velocity distally. Since most human movement is aimed at maximizing angular displacement of a distal segment through space, the use of 3rd class levers for is very efficient.\n\nThis creates a relationship between the lever arm distance, distal angular displacement/velocity, and torque production. The shorter the lever arm of the effort force (decreased mechanical advantage), the greater angular displacement and angular velocity of the distal end of the lever for a given arc of displacement of the effort force. The larger the lever arm of the effort force (increased mechanical advantage), the increased torque production.\n\nThis lever arm and force/torque production relationship needs to be taken into consideration when assessing movement and prescribing interventions. For example, applying a 5 pound weight at the distal end of a lever during a scaption/SLR exercise creates a mechanical disadvantage for the supraspinatus/illiopsoas. This results in the muscle being overloaded in attempt to create the amount of torque necessary for the distal angular displacement."]}
